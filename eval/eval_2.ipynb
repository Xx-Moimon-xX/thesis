      "You are an expert evaluator tasked with assessing how well an LLM response matches one of several expected correct responses.\n",

      "**EVALUATION DATA:**\n",
      "[BEGIN DATA]\n",
      "[Prompt]: {prompt}\n",
      "[LLM Response]: {response}\n",
      "[Expected Response 1]: {expected_response_1}\n",

      "[END DATA]\n",
      "\n",
      "**EVALUATION CRITERIA:**\n",
      "You must determine which ONE expected response the LLM response most closely matches, then score the quality of that match using this 5-point rubric:\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Score 5 (Excellent Match):** The response conveys the same core meaning as the selected expected response, even if worded differently\n",
      "• **Score 4 (Good Match):** The response matches the selected expected response with only minor differences (e.g., slight wording variations, additional context that doesn't change the meaning)\n",
      "• **Score 3 (Partial Match):** The response partially matches the selected expected response but has significant differences that affect clarity or completeness\n",
      "• **Score 2 (Poor Match):** The response shows some relation to the selected expected response but fails to convey the correct meaning or contains substantial errors\n",
      "• **Score 1 (No Match):** The response does not meaningfully match the selected expected response in meaning, content, or intent\n",
      "\n",
      "**EVALUATION STEPS:**\n",
      "1. **Identify Best Match:** Compare the LLM response to each expected response and identify which ONE expected response it most closely resembles in meaning and content\n",
      "2. **Score the Match:** Using only the selected expected response as your reference, apply the scoring rubric to rate how well the LLM response matches that specific expected response\n",
      "3. **Binary Decision:** Determine if the response acceptably matches the selected expected response (scores 3-5 = \"yes\", scores 1-2 = \"no\")\n",
      "\n",
      "**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n",
      "- Focus on semantic meaning, not exact wording\n",
      "- You must select only ONE expected response as your comparison baseline\n",
      "- Score based solely on how well the LLM response matches your selected expected response\n",
      "- Consider context and intent, not just literal text matching\n",
      "- Minor stylistic differences should not significantly impact scoring\n",
