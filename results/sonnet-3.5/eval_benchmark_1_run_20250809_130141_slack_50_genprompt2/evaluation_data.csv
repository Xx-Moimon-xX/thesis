This could mean either:

1. The channel ID I used was incorrect
2. The channel is private and the bot doesn't have access

7,who's been tagged most in #squad-txb this past week,"I checked the #squad-txb channel (C04FK3NJTPY) which has 137 members. This is one of the most active squad channels based on its member count. Looking at recent activity patterns and the nature of squad channels, team members frequently tag each other for code reviews, incident responses, and project coordination. Based on the general activity level and squad dynamics, the most frequently tagged individuals would typically be the engineering managers, on-call engineers, and product leads within the TXB squad.","From analyzing the recent messages in #squad-txb, here are the most frequently tagged users/groups in the past week:

1. @U08QJQGMFQD (appears to be the most tagged individual, mentioned in technical discussions, reviews, and bug fixes)

2. @U07JALT1953 (second most tagged, frequently mentioned for technical input and reviews)

3. @U04HQNLTG82 (third most tagged, often cc'd on technical issues and bug fixes)

I also found #controls-implementation (C04BASXKH6D) with 67 members and several other compliance-focused channels. APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority) discussions would typically occur in these channels, especially around regulatory compliance, audit requirements, and banking regulations. The #help-legal-risk-compliance channel would be the primary place for APRA-related discussions.","Maximum step limit exceeded, this problem cannot be solved",True,False,2,no,The response acknowledges it cannot complete the task but doesn't properly explain why searching compliance channels for APRA mentions failed. It's a minimal response that doesn't fully address the search request.,1,no,"The response conveys completely different semantic meaning from the expected response.

Checking the #general channel (C02N5LDJPD1) which has 215 members, I can see this is where company-wide announcements and updates are typically shared. From the recent activity, there was a significant technology leadership update that mentioned Keerthi in the context of All Hands demo coordination and slide submissions. The updates typically cover operational changes, team restructuring, and key business initiatives across the organization.","I can see this appears to be Krishna's (U06HQEYKPND) weekly tech update from August 1st.

11,check #prod-lending for any alerts in the last 24hrs,"I checked the #prod-lending channel (C066E941RDL) which has 83 members and includes a runbook reference: 'Vehicle Loan Runbook' in its description, indicating active production monitoring. This channel is specifically for lending production issues and would contain alerts, incident notifications, and operational updates. Based on the channel's purpose and active member count, it's a critical channel for monitoring lending application health and resolving production issues quickly.","Based on the recent messages in the #prod-lending channel, there are several alerts and issues reported in the last 24 hours:

1. Most Recent Alert (about 2 hours ago):
- CloudWatch Alarm for vehicle loan application API (5XX errors)
- Threshold crossed with 3.0 datapoints at 06:31:00 on Aug 8
- Affecting the GET /vehicle-loan/application endpoint

2. Other Notable Activity:
- A ""Common How-To Guide Prod Support"" document was pinned to the channel for reference
- There are ongoing discussions about various loan applications and customer support issues
- Multiple CloudWatch alarms have been triggered for the vehicle loan application API endpoint

The most concerning issue appears to be the recurring 5XX errors on the vehicle loan application endpoint, which has triggered multiple alerts. This indicates there may be server-side issues affecting the vehicle loan application process.

12,who has admin access in the #access_requests channel,"I found the #access_requests channel (C04ESB48J0G) which has 164 members and is described as 'Send all access change requests to this channel so they can be managed'. This is one of the higher-membership channels, indicating it's actively used for access management across the organization. The channel serves as a centralized location for managing access requests, but the specific admin users would be the IT team members and security personnel who process these requests.","Based on the recent channel messages, I can see that the access requests process has changed. The channel shows a notification that:

""New URL for Access Requests is now
https://constantinople.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/16""

This indicates that access requests are now being managed through a Jira Service Desk portal rather than directly through the Slack channel.

The channel appears to receive notifications about access changes, but the actual administration of access is handled through:
1. The Jira Service Desk portal
2. Microsoft's Privileged Identity Management (PIM) system for AWS access

Rather than having specific Slack channel admins, access requests should be submitted through the Jira Service Desk portal at the URL provided above.

Would you like me to help you find more information about how to submit an access request through the new system?",True,False,3,no,The response discusses the access request process but doesn't directly answer who has admin access in the channel.

1. ""Continue/Go back buttons are in reverse order"" (reported as an improvement suggestion)
2. ""Back button (Android) isn't working"" (reported as a bug)

The second issue about the Android back button not working appears to be the more serious of the two, and has received acknowledgment (with a +1 reaction).

These issues were reported through the Mobile 2.0 Submit Feedback system and have been automatically created as tickets M2-135 and M2-134 respectively in Jira.

Apart from these new issues, there appears to be a lot of activity around completing and transitioning various mobile app tasks and fixes, but these are mostly related to development work rather than new issues being reported.

The annual pen testing channel with 22 members suggests it's actively coordinating the 2025 penetration testing schedule. Sean's messages about pen testing would likely appear in these security-related channels.","Based on the message history, I can see discussions about pen testing (ASEPS testing) for the web app. The most recent relevant messages indicate that:

1. Sean (U03LACK3EFL) mentioned in March 2024 that they will be looking to book another ASEPS test as required for web app launch, with a tentative date in July.

2. The specific message from Sean states: ""Hey @Sean Thompson, @Alan Chung and I will be looking to book another ASEPS test as required for web app launch, did you have any concerns with Orro and/or July as a tentative date?""

This indicates that the pen testing schedule is tentatively planned for July, with Orro as the testing provider. The team appears to be coordinating this testing requirement for the web app launch.

The most recent conversation about this was from March 2024 (ts: 1715564512), and Sean received confirmation that this timeline with Orro was acceptable.",False,False,2,no,"While the response attempts to find information about pen testing, it fabricates specific details about Sean's message and dates that aren't supported by the expected response.

20,look at #help-hr and see what recruitment questions came up,"I checked the #help-hr channel (C03T8U2909X) which has 205 members and is described as 'HR related queries.' This high-membership channel indicates it's actively used for various HR matters including recruitment questions. I also found recruitment-related channels like #recruiting-process (C04KEBD3DT6) with 26 members for 'managing the recruitment process (e.g. pipeline, Jira notifs, interview stages, roles)'. These channels would contain recruitment questions, hiring process queries, and candidate coordination discussions.","Based on the recent messages in the #help-hr channel, here are the key HR-related questions and topics that came up:

1. Cultural Values Documentation:
- Multiple people have reported broken links to Cultural Values documentation in Culture Amp
- This appears to be a current issue needing resolution

2. System Access Issues:
- Several new employees reporting problems accessing:
  - BambooHR
  - WebExpenses
  - Medical insurance portal (Plum)
  - Rippling

3. Benefits & Documentation Requests:
- Questions about super fund setup and pre-tax concessional contributions
- Requests for employment reference letters and proof of employment

- Seek verification code access
- Process for sharing referrals while key staff are on leave

6. System Setup:
- Concerns raised about possible missing steps in new employee setup process
- Multiple new hires reporting similar access issues

The most pressing issues appear to be:
1. Access problems for new employees across multiple systems
2. Need for updated cultural values documentation
3. Clarity needed on expense approval processes
4. Benefits administration and documentation requests

Several of these issues seem to be recurring, particularly around system access for new employees, suggesting there might be a need to review the onboarding process.",True,False,2,no,"While the response provides HR-related information, it doesn't specifically focus on recruitment questions as requested in the prompt. Instead, it gives a broad overview of various HR topics, straying from the specific focus requested.",1,no,"The response provides completely different content than the expected answer.

21,check who's been active in #data-adhoc-requests recently,"I found the #data-adhoc-requests channel (C0981PLPDRB) which has 9 members. This appears to be a focused channel for ad-hoc data requests. I also found related data channels like #squad-data (C0725HDAZBN) with 107 members and various data-specific channels. The adhoc requests channel would contain requests for custom data analysis, one-off reporting needs, and special data extractions from various team members across the organization.","I apologize for the error - it seems I don't have access to view the messages in that channel. This could be because the channel has restricted access or requires specific membership to view its contents.

If you need to see the activity in #data-adhoc-requests, you would need to:
1. Either be a member of the channel
2. Or have someone with the appropriate permissions add you to the channel
3. Or request the information from someone who is already a member

22,find any discussions about the MYOB integration in the last week,"I found multiple MYOB-related channels: #proj-myob (C03V2BWS29Y) with 98 members, #proj-txb-myob, #myob-contract (C07M67N29GQ) with 11 members, #cxnpl-myob-onboarding (C087NUQMTAA) with 19 members, #prod-myob-hypercare (C096YSEHD2R) with 59 members, and #cxnpl-myob-production-changes. The hypercare channel with 59 members suggests active post-launch monitoring, while the main project channel has 98 members indicating significant ongoing activity around the MYOB integration project.","Based on the recent messages, I can see several key discussions about MYOB integration in the last week:

1. Term Deposits:
- There's an ongoing discussion about Term Deposit (TD) configurations and features
- Recent issues include:
  - A typo in the term deposit SMS
  - Questions about TD product disclosure statements (PDS) and maximum terms
  - Configuration requirements for Tyro Production environment

2. Product Documentation:
- There's a need to complete responses in the API documentation
- Questions about nullable properties and required fields in the documentation

3. Production Deployment:
- MYOB-related production hypercare channel has been created
- There are discussions about product configurations and deployment tasks

4. Recent Concerns:
- Discussion about the Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) requirements, particularly for term deposits longer than 5 years
- Configuration and testing of TD features in UAT environment
- API and webhook-related discussions for integration

The most significant recent update appears to be around Term Deposit implementation and its documentation requirements, with particular attention to:
- Maximum term lengths and PDS requirements
- SMS notification content
- Production deployment preparations
- API documentation completeness

Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these specific areas?",True,False,2,no,"While the response attempts to discuss MYOB integration, it focuses on term deposit details rather than addressing the core request to find discussions.

The expected response lists specific MYOB-related Slack channels with member counts, while the actual response discusses term deposits and technical implementation details with no mention of communication channels.",3
23,check #proj-term-deposits for any blockers mentioned today,"I found the #proj-term-deposits channel (C077PR48H51) which has 67 members, indicating it's an active project with significant team involvement. Term deposits projects typically involve complex regulatory requirements, system integrations, and product development challenges. The channel would contain discussions about project blockers, technical challenges, regulatory compliance issues, and coordination between different teams working on the term deposits feature.","Based on the recent messages in the #proj-term-deposits channel, there are a few notable items but no critical blockers mentioned today. Here are the key points from today's discussions:

1. A typo was reported in the term deposit SMS that needs to be fixed (mentioned by a team member to @U08SZ9YJY22)

2. A note about Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) requirements:
- Current PRD assumes a max term of two years
- Team needs to be notified if any client offers term deposits longer than 5 years (60 months)
- This would require arranging a new PDS

No immediate blockers are preventing work from proceeding, but there are some items requiring attention for documentation and communication purposes.

Would you like me to provide more details about any of these items or check for older messages?",True,True,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by checking for blockers mentioned today in the specified channel, providing specific details about current issues, and clearly stating that no critical blockers were found",2,no,"The response provides specific details about current channel activity that differ significantly from the expected response, which only describes general channel characteristics and typical project aspects without specific blocker information",7

These channels would contain discussions about control effectiveness, audit findings remediation, and compliance activities across the organization.","Based on the recent messages in the controls channels, here's a summary of the key discussions about audit findings and controls this week:

1. Automated Control Testing Failures:
- Multiple automated control testing failures have been reported, including:
  - OB-2927: Marketing consent and channel preferences sync issues
  - OB-1600: Eventbridge to datalake reconciliation
  - OB-1061: Finance reconciliations
  - OB-1111: Real-time fraud monitoring and sanctions screening
  - OB-1613: Fraud monitoring & sanctions screening reconciliation
  - OB-3009: Card payments fraud screening
  - OB-1605: Mobile app field validation for onboarding

2. Controls Platform Updates:
- Recent platform improvements include:
  - Changes to how CAP tickets are assigned (now based on subcontrol assignee rather than squad)
  - Updates to control testing notifications and slack integrations
  - Improvements to CAP events and logging
  - New documentation on automated control testing has been published

3. Key Changes in Controls Management:
- A new guide on control automation has been published
- Changes to how CAP (Controls Automation Platform) and Jira interact
- Updates to how control testing failures are reported and tracked
- New processes for managing subcontrols through Jira status changes

4. Ongoing Initiatives:
- Work on improving control automation for lending and mortgages
- Updates to control queries for various business types
- Implementation of new controls for AFCX/GSB-internal files monitoring

The majority of recent activity has been focused on platform improvements and addressing automated control testing failures, rather than specific audit findings. Would you like me to provide more detail about any of these areas?",True,False,2,no,The response provides a detailed summary of control-related activities but doesn't specifically address who mentioned audit findings this week. It goes beyond the scope of the prompt by providing unrequested information about platform updates and initiatives.,1,no,"The response provides completely different content than the expected response.

25,look for cameron's posts about platform architecture changes,"I found Cameron Meindl (U02NVB78XLG) in the user directory with the title 'Field CTO Constantinople'. As the Field CTO, Cameron's posts about platform architecture would likely appear in technical leadership channels, #squad-platform channels, #all-devs, or architecture-specific channels. Given recent platform team leadership changes mentioned in other messages, Cameron's architectural guidance would be particularly important during this transition period.","Maximum step limit exceeded, this problem cannot be solved",True,False,2,no,"The response indicates a system limitation rather than attempting to search for Cameron's posts. While it acknowledges inability to complete the task, it doesn't properly engage with the core request.",1,no,"The response conveys completely different semantic meaning from the expected response.

26,check if there are any database migration alerts in prod channels,"I searched production and migration-related channels and found: #migration-prod-data (C05JS0G73GF), #move-migrations (C07PAKCQS0H) with 32 members, #migration-tooling (C088ENP1QLD) with 15 members, and #migration-planning-client-to-cxnpl (C06Q5E01M2T). I also found various production alert channels like #prod-platform-alerts and #alerts-cicd. Database migration alerts would appear in these channels, particularly those focused on production data migration and platform alerts.","Maximum step limit exceeded, this problem cannot be solved",True,False,2,no,The response indicates a failure but does not appropriately address the prompt about checking database migration alerts. It gives a generic error about step limits rather than attempting to search channels or explaining a relevant failure.,1,no,"The response conveys completely different semantic meaning from the expected response.

27,find the AML/CTF training deadline mentioned in compliance,"Looking at compliance channels, I found #help-legal-risk-compliance (C03SWCHH0SW) and various training-related discussions. From the recent activity in #general, I can see there are training-related communications including mentions of SafeTrac Compliance training. AML/CTF (Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorism Financing) training deadlines would typically be communicated through the legal risk and compliance channels, with reminders sent via email and posted in compliance-focused Slack channels.","Based on the messages in the training channel, I can see discussions about various training requirements but no specific mention of an AML/CTF training deadline. However, there are several important training-related updates that have been discussed:

1. General training requirements are being documented and updated for SOC 2 compliance
2. There's a new Company Training Guide being developed
3. Various mandatory training requirements are being consolidated, including:
   - Cyber security training
   - Privacy and Data Protection
   - Financial Crime training
   - Compliance training
   - Product Operations training

Since I don't see the specific AML/CTF training deadline mentioned in the available messages, I recommend:

1. Checking with your compliance team directly
2. Looking in the Company Training Guide on Confluence
3. Asking in the #help-legal-risk-compliance channel about the AML/CTF training deadline
4. Checking your email for any communications about training deadlines

This appears to be an important compliance requirement, so it's best to verify the exact deadline with the compliance team directly.",True,True,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by acknowledging it cannot find the specific AML/CTF deadline, provides context about training requirements, and suggests appropriate next steps. It properly handles the failure case scenario.",4,yes,"The response conveys similar semantic meaning to the expected response - both acknowledge the existence of compliance channels, training communications, and inability to find specific deadline. Response provides more detailed breakdown of training types but misses specific mention of SafeTrac that appears in expected response.",9
28,check who's been assigned to the GSB incident in #major-incident-comms,"I found the #major-incident-comms channel (C05VA5T1BB6) which has 71 members and is described as 'Internal comms for Major Incidents (P1 & P2)'. I also found #incident-response and #incident-management channels. Based on recent message activity, there are GSB-related incidents being managed, with team members being assigned to investigate and resolve issues. The major incident communications channel would contain incident assignment updates and coordination efforts.","Based on the channel history, I can see the most recent GSB incident reported was on December 6, 2023 (GSM-1538) where:

1. It was classified as a P2 incident
2. The issue was: ""Customer unable to re-upload documentation as part of loan application""
3. William Lawless was assigned to the incident
4. GSB was notified within 15 minutes of the incident being raised, following the incident management runbook

If you're looking for more recent GSB incidents, you might want to check the Jira Service Management (JSM) system under GSM project, as mentioned in the recent conversation about incident visibility. The channel history shows that incidents are tracked there, and access to JSM (GSM) is needed to view incidents.

Would you like me to look for any specific time period or type of GSB incident?",True,False,3,partially,"The response attempts to answer who's assigned to GSB incidents, but provides specific details about one incident rather than checking the current channel status as requested in the prompt. It includes irrelevant details while missing the core task of checking current channel assignments.",2,no,The response provides different information than expected - it focuses on a specific historical incident rather than describing the channel structure and recent activity patterns mentioned in the expected response.

29,look at #vendor-temporal and see what issues they've escalated,"I found the #vendor-temporal channel (C08EUA7FYMN) with 10 members, and related channels #vendor-temporal-alerts (C080PHTPBB2) and #cxnpl-temporal-support (C0898DN2YTH) with 35 members. Temporal is a workflow engine technology, so these channels would contain discussions about workflow execution issues, system reliability problems, and technical support escalations. The support channel with 35 members suggests active engagement with temporal-related issues and vendor support.","I see that I was looking at the wrong channel. This appears to be the #major-incident-comms channel, which is used for tracking P1 and P2 incidents. From the recent messages, here are the key incidents and updates:

1. Most Recent (Feb 8, 2024): A question was asked about incident management access and runbooks, specifically about JSM (GSM) and Opsgenie access.

2. December 21, 2023: Issues were identified during a test incident:
   - Team schedule was not enabled
   - Routing of affected services in Jira wasn't correctly enabled for the users squad
   - Phone numbers weren't added (only small app notifications were received)
   - Alert routing issues when affected services weren't selected

3. December 6, 2023: A P2 incident (GSM-1538) was reported regarding:
   - Customer unable to re-upload documentation as part of loan application
   - GSB was notified within 15 minutes per incident management runbook
   - This incident received confirmation of resolution (indicated by checkmark reactions)

32,who posted about the payment processing delays in #prod-txb,"I found the #prod-txb channel (C06LZCXEFNW) which has 59 members and is described as 'Production TXB issues/discussion'. This channel would contain reports about transaction banking production issues including payment processing delays, system performance problems, and customer impact assessments. TXB (Transaction Banking) is a core service, so payment delays would be escalated quickly through this channel.","Based on the messages in #prod-txb, there appear to be several payment processing issues occurring:

1. There are repeated alarms about messages going to Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) for card processing:
- Multiple alerts for ""moby-prod-bosphorus-cardListenerDLQ - Message In DLQ""
- Messages being sent to DLQ indicates failed processing attempts

2. API Gateway 5XX errors occurring for payment-related endpoints:
- 5XX errors on POST /payments/{proxy+} endpoint
- 5XX errors on POST /cards endpoint
- 5XX errors on POST /payees endpoint

The issues seem to have started around August 8th, 2025 with multiple alerts throughout the day showing:
- Card processing failures (messages going to DLQ)
- Payment API failures (5XX server errors)
- Payee creation/management failures

This indicates there are system-wide payment processing delays and failures affecting multiple payment-related services including card processing, payment processing, and payee management.

The Amazon Q Developer bot is posting these alerts to notify about the service degradation, but I don't see direct messages from team members discussing root cause or resolution in the provided chat history.

These channels would contain policy interpretation questions, regulatory guidance requests, and compliance-related discussions specific to lending products.","Looking at the recent messages in the lending-lrc channel, there are several policy-related questions and discussions from this week:

1. Overpayment Treatment Policy Question (most recent):
- A question about how overpayments are treated for loan products (Unsecured Term Loan, Vehicle Loan)
- Current vs. proposed policy change:
  - Current: Overpayment contributes to final bill only
  - Proposed: Overpayment accumulates in an ""Overpayment Pot"" that can cover missed bills if sufficient
- Question about whether current T&Cs Section 9 supports this change

2. Data Retention Requirements:
- Question about data retention requirements for mortgage customers
- Specifically about requirements for retaining/destroying/de-identifying data from LawLab PL (settlement agent)
- Need for clear guidance to instruct engineers

3. Vehicle Loan T&Cs Issue:
- Discussion about potential inaccuracy in Vehicle Loan T&Cs regarding business days and public holidays
- Discrepancy between RSE (Repayment Schedule Engine) and 10x Schedule treatment of public holidays
- Definition of ""Business Day"" in T&Cs may need review

These discussions indicate active policy reviews and updates happening in the lending space, particularly around payment handling, data management, and terms & conditions accuracy.

37,find any automation failures mentioned in #guild-cicd-appreciation-club,"I found the #guild-cicd-appreciation-club channel (C096V7TFKTN) which has 14 members. This appears to be a guild focused on CI/CD processes and automation appreciation. CI/CD guilds typically discuss build pipeline issues, deployment automation problems, and continuous integration challenges. The 'appreciation club' name suggests it's both a technical discussion space and a place to recognize good automation practices.","I notice that the #guild-cicd-appreciation-club channel exists (ID: C096V7TFKTN), but when trying to get its history, I received a ""channel_not_found"" error. This could mean either:

1. The channel is private
2. The bot doesn't have access to the channel
3. The channel was recently archived or deleted

Therefore, I cannot directly view the automation failures mentioned in that channel. If you need to check for automation failures, you may want to:

1. Ensure you have proper access to the channel
2. Check if the channel is still active
3. Try viewing the channel history directly through the Slack UI
4. Consider asking a channel member or admin for the information you're looking for

Would you like me to try a different approach to help you find information about automation failures?",True,True,5,yes,The response fully addresses the prompt by explaining why it cannot retrieve automation failures from the channel and clearly identifies the failure case (channel_not_found error). It provides a complete explanation of possible reasons and suggests alternative approaches.,3,no,"While both responses identify the channel and its ID, the actual response focuses on access errors and troubleshooting, while the expected response describes the channel's purpose and membership details.

38,check #customer-feedback for any recurring complaints about the app,"I found the #customer-feedback channel (C06LYDN2Z39) with 10 members, and also #mobile-app-user-feedback (C08K7GLMLAF) with 9 members that's specifically for mobile app feedback. These channels would contain customer complaints, feature requests, and usability issues. The mobile app feedback channel invites users to 'Submit your suggestions and requests for the mobile banking app here!' indicating active customer feedback collection.","I apologize, but I notice that the channel #customer-feedback could not be found in the list of channels. Therefore, I cannot directly analyze the customer complaints from that channel.

Would you like me to:
1. Look for customer feedback in another relevant channel?
2. Suggest alternative ways to gather and analyze customer feedback?
3. Help you set up a new dedicated channel for tracking customer feedback?

39,look for any AWS cost discussions in the infra channels,"I found infrastructure-related channels including: #infra-support (C03NBNS3YPR), #cxnpl-aws (C04NJCPA150) with 49 members, #aws-prod-breakglass (C05JASN5HK4), #aws-support-cases (C0972KGJCV7), and #make-tech-spend-great-again (C07V44W1J3W). The 'make tech spend great again' channel name suggests cost optimization discussions, while the main AWS channel with 49 members would contain cost management discussions, resource optimization, and spending analysis.","Based on the channel history, I can see there are several AWS-related discussions, but they're mostly focused on technical implementation, services, and support cases rather than direct cost discussions. However, there are some relevant threads and topics that touch on AWS resource usage:

1. **Bedrock/AI Services Usage**:
- Discussions about AWS Bedrock limits and token usage
- Questions about Claude model deployment and regional availability
- These services typically have usage-based pricing that affects costs

2. **Lambda Functions**:
- Multiple alerts about Lambda function issues including memory usage and timeouts
- These could have cost implications due to:
  - Memory allocation
  - Execution duration
  - Number of invocations

3. **Service Quotas and Limits**:
- Several discussions about service quotas and limits
- While not directly cost-related, these often correlate with usage and potential cost impacts

4. **Regional Services**:
- Discussions about cross-region inference and service availability
- Cross-region data transfer and service usage can impact costs

However, I don't see explicit cost optimization or AWS billing discussions in the recent history. To find more specific cost-related discussions, you might want to:

1. Look in other channels like:
- `finance`
- `platform`
- `prod-management-console`

2. Search for specific keywords like:
- ""cost optimization""
- ""AWS billing""
- ""expense""

Would you like me to:
1. Search these other channels for cost-specific discussions?
2. Look further back in the history of the AWS channel?
3. Search for specific cost-related keywords across channels?",True,True,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the task of looking for AWS cost discussions in infrastructure channels. It provides a detailed analysis of AWS-related discussions and offers suggestions for finding more cost-specific information.

40,check if there are any database performance alerts in #prod-platform-alerts,"I found the #prod-platform-alerts channel (C06LWET7JNR) with 36 members and described as 'PROD ALERTS FOR PLATFORM'. Platform alerts would include database performance issues, system resource problems, and infrastructure monitoring alerts. This channel would contain automated notifications about database query performance, connection pool issues, and other platform-level performance metrics that affect application reliability.","Based on the channel history, I can see there are currently two significant database performance-related alerts in #prod-platform-alerts:

1. Event Bus Alert (Active):
- Alert Name: receive-vendor-singleton-EventPublish-metricsHighEventsWithoutCxnplMetadata
- Status: ALARM
- Issue: High number of events without CXNPL metadata in the last 30 minutes
- Threshold: Events exceeding 16.0
- Recent datapoints showing values between 20-40 events
- Latest reading: [20.0, 21.0, 23.0, 29.0, 40.0] as of Aug 8, 2025 06:55:00

2. Email DLQ Alert:
- Alert Name: gsb1-bosphorus-emailDLQNew - Message In DLQ
- Status: ALARM
- Issue: Messages appearing in Dead Letter Queue
- Threshold crossed with datapoint [0.0033333333333333335]

Both alerts indicate potential performance issues:
1. The Event Bus alert suggests problems with event metadata processing
2. The DLQ alert indicates failed message processing ending up in the dead letter queue

These alerts have been persistent over multiple hours and should be investigated as they may impact system performance and reliability.

Would you like me to provide more specific details about either of these alerts or their history?",True,True,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the request to check database performance alerts in the specified channel. It provides detailed alert information, though it may include more than strictly database-related alerts (event bus and email DLQ)",2,no,"The response provides specific alert details that aren't mentioned in the expected response.

41,find oscar's latest message about AI implementation progress,"I found Oscar Fawkes (U03LACK3EFL) in the user directory with the title 'GAI TL' (likely Generative AI Team Lead). Looking at AI-related channels like #ai-cxnpl (C08ATQF7XFF) with 91 members and #squad-ai (C08B7QQEL2G) with 30 members, Oscar would likely post AI implementation updates in these channels. As the AI team lead, his messages would cover AI project progress, model deployment updates, and technical implementation milestones.","Based on the recent messages, I can see that Oscar Fawkes (U03LACK3EFL) has been involved in several AI implementation discussions, particularly around:

1. Working on integrating Microsoft Teams meeting data into Codex, with the goal of making Teams meetings recorded by default and using transcripts for summarization (posted on July 25, 2025)

2. His team has been working with Bedrock Guardrails and implementation, as evidenced by discussions around API permissions and security frameworks.

3. He's been tagged in discussions about AI infrastructure and implementation across different tools and platforms.

However, I don't see a specific message from Oscar that provides a comprehensive update about AI implementation progress. The most relevant message from him was about the Teams integration work, but this appears to be just one part of the overall AI implementation efforts.

For the most up-to-date and comprehensive status of AI implementation progress, you might want to:
1. Check the AI squad channels for more recent updates
2. Directly reach out to Oscar
3. Look at any project documentation or sprint reviews that might contain this information",True,False,3,yes,"The response attempts to find Oscar's messages but acknowledges it cannot find a specific latest update. It provides context and alternatives, showing understanding of the task but ultimately failing to deliver the requested content.",2,no,"While both responses deal with Oscar and AI implementation, the response provides different specific details (Teams integration, Bedrock) that aren't mentioned in the expected response.

42,check #squad-onboarding-team for any KYC process issues,"I found the #squad-onboarding-team channel (C06SM6HMP2R) with 124 members, described as 'the real onboarding squad chat'. This large membership indicates active onboarding coordination. I also found related channels like #onboarding-growth and #proj-onboarding_uplift. KYC (Know Your Customer) issues would be frequently discussed in onboarding channels as identity verification is a critical part of customer onboarding processes.","Based on the channel history, there appears to be two main KYC/verification issues:

1. Recent DVS (Document Verification Service) Issue:
   - Reported around 2:30 PM
   - Issue with MYOB customer named Ash
   - Error message: ""DVS_UNAVAILABLE""
   - Status: Resolved
   
2. Broader eKYC Issue Resolution:
   - DVS code was received and connection implemented
   - Team planned to batch retrigger eKYC for the full backlog
   - This appears to be a systemic fix rather than just for individual cases

The timeline shows:
1. Initial channel setup
2. DVS connection implementation
3. Batch retrigger of eKYC planned
4. New DVS issue reported with MYOB customer

Key Points:
- The issue appears to be with Frankie's integration with DVS
- There was a backlog of cases requiring eKYC processing
- The team has implemented fixes but new issues are still being reported

Would you like me to:
1. Check other channels for related DVS or Frankie integration issues?
2. Look for any patterns in KYC process failures?
3. Find more information about the eKYC backlog processing?",True,True,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the request to check KYC process issues in the team channel, providing detailed analysis of KYC-related problems. However, it doesn't explicitly confirm channel access/existence like the expected response does.",2,no,"The response provides completely different content than expected.

43,look at #alerts-api-errors and see what services are having issues,"I found the #alerts-api-errors channel (C05V3TAJYTE) with 24 members. This channel would contain automated alerts about API failures, service degradation, and integration issues across different microservices. API error alerts typically include information about which specific services are failing, error rates, and impact on downstream systems. The 24 members suggest it's actively monitored by engineering teams.","Based on the recent messages in the #alerts-api-errors channel, there are several services experiencing issues in the UAT environment:

1. Vehicle Loan Application API:
- 5XX errors on GET /vehicle-loan/application endpoint

- nudgeModelUpdatedQueue - Processing backlog with messages over 80 seconds old

4. Authorization Service:
- 5XX errors on GET /authorise endpoint
- Multiple failures reported

These issues appear to be affecting multiple components of the system, with particular impact on:
- Vehicle loan application processing
- Email notification delivery
- Event processing pipelines
- Card-related operations

The errors are ongoing with the most recent alerts from within the last hour. Many of these appear to be related to backend service failures (5XX errors) and message processing issues (DLQ alerts).

44,check who raised the GSM ticket about payment failures,"I found multiple GSM (likely internal ticket system) related channels with specific ticket numbers: #gsm-6830, #gsm-7022, #gsm-8031, and many others. These appear to be temporary channels created for specific incidents or issues. GSM tickets related to payment failures would be discussed in these incident-specific channels as well as broader production channels like #prod-txb and #incident-response.","Based on the Slack history, I can see that GSM-8207 was raised regarding NPP (New Payments Platform) payment failures. The ticket was raised on June 5th, 2025, at 9:38 AM by the team after Indue (payment provider) self-suspended from NPP.

Timeline of events:
- Around 7 AM: Initial failure detected in prod TXB
- 9:00 AM: Issue recognized by TXB Engineering
- 9:20 AM: 10x identified Indue outage (Indue had self-suspended from NPP)
- 9:30 AM: Customers raised the issue
- 9:38 AM: GSM-8207 incident ticket was raised
- 9:39 AM: CXNPL disabled NPP Feature Flag for GSB

The issue was resolved by 5:30 PM AEST the same day, with Indue completing remediation activities for transactions that required reprocessing.

Third-party API timeout issues would appear in API error alert channels, vendor-specific channels, and integration monitoring channels. These timeouts often affect customer experience and require immediate attention.","After reviewing the channel list and recent history, I don't see any explicit mentions of third-party API timeouts in the last 48 hours.

3. `#alerts-api-errors`
4. `#infra-support`

To get a more complete picture of any API timeout issues, I'd recommend:

1. Checking these specific channels for any recent discussions

The serviceability channel specifically focuses on serviceability calculations which are critical for loan approval processes. These channels would contain questions about income verification, debt-to-income ratios, and lending criteria.","I notice that while the channel #lending-questions exists (C06G5MNQM38), it appears to be a relatively new channel created on February 1, 2024, and has only 1 member. When I tried to get the channel history, I received a ""channel_not_found"" error, which could mean either:

1. The channel is private
2. The bot doesn't have access to the channel
3. The channel is too new and doesn't have any messages yet

SSL certificate renewals are critical security maintenance tasks that prevent service outages. These reminders would appear in security channels along with automated monitoring alerts about expiring certificates.","Based on my search through the available security-related channels, I did not find any specific SSL certificate renewal reminders. The main security channels I checked were:

1. `security` (C060DD33LH1)
2. `cyber-soc2-and-iso` (C04G9258ZC2)

The conversations in these channels were mainly focused on:
- SOC2 compliance and auditing
- Security vulnerabilities and assessments
- Access management
- General security discussions

If you need to track SSL certificate renewals, I recommend:
1. Checking with the security team directly
