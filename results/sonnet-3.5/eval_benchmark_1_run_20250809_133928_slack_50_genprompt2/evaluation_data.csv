0,can you check who's been most active in #fraud-fincrime-ops this week,"I checked the #fraud-fincrime-ops channel (C05HPT6MWAE) and found recent activity from several team members. Looking at the message history, the most active participants this week include Lily Doyle, Campbell Wang, and Chloe Lee, who have been actively discussing customer cases, identity fraud investigations, and account offboarding procedures. The conversations show typical fraud team activities like reviewing suspicious transactions, handling MCL cases, and coordinating with GSB on customer communications.","Based on the recent activity in #fraud-fincrime-ops, here are the key points from the past week:

The channel appears to be very active with fraud prevention and monitoring activities, with multiple team members actively collaborating on cases throughout the day.",False,False,4,yes,"The response addresses the core prompt by providing information about activity in the specified channel, including identifying active participants. However, it provides more general information than specifically requested about 'most active' members.",2,no,"The response names different team members (Christina Lee vs. Lily Doyle, Campbell Wang, Chloe Lee) and provides much more detailed but potentially inaccurate information about activities. While some general concepts overlap, the specific details differ significantly from the expected response.",6
1,find me the latest message from di_challenor about releases,"I searched through Di Challenor's recent activity and found her latest message regarding releases was posted in the #general channel. Her message discusses technology leadership changes and includes updates about platform team restructuring, but doesn't contain specific release information. For specific release updates, you might want to check the #release-sprintly channel where release calendar information is typically shared.","Based on the messages I can see, I don't find any recent messages specifically from di_challenor about releases. However, I can see that there have been several important release-related updates from others:

1. The most recent release announcement was about v2.39, with UAT deployment planned for August 13th
2. There was also discussion about v2.38 production deployment

Would you like me to:
1. Search through older messages specifically for di_challenor's updates
2. Share more details about the current release status
3. Look in other release-related channels

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed and I'll help you find the specific information you're looking for.",True,True,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the request to find di_challenor's latest message about releases by acknowledging it cannot find specific release messages, and offers alternative approaches. However, it misses mentioning the actual latest message found in #general channel.",2,no,"While both responses indicate an inability to find specific release messages from di_challenor, the actual response misses key information present in the expected response: the existence of a message in #general about leadership changes, and the specific reference to #release-sprintly channel for release updates.",6
2,check #incident-response and see if there are any P1s currently active,"I checked the #incident-response channel (C05MS15CMHU) for current P1 incidents. Based on the recent message history, there are no currently active P1 incidents. The channel shows typical incident management activity with automated notifications and closed incidents. The channel description indicates it's used for 'Incidents FAQs and response' and appears to be actively monitored by the incident response team.","Based on the recent messages in the #incident-response channel, there are several active incidents, but none are explicitly marked as P1. Here are the most recent active incidents:

1. GSM-8637: Transaction experiencing a processing delay (In-Progress)
2. GSM-8636: Collection Notice issued without GSB approval (In-Progress)
3. GSM-8634: The root detection for Mobile App reports false positives (Open)
4. GSM-8631: Bankers Console - Unable to access (Open)
5. CIMP-116: Regression introduced on card auth clearing & chargeback process (Open)

While there are multiple incidents, none are explicitly marked as P1 priority - they are all currently marked as ""Unprioritised"". However, there are some potentially customer-impacting issues like transaction processing delays and banking console access issues that are being actively worked on.

Would you like more details about any of these specific incidents or would you like me to look further back in the channel history?",True,True,5,yes,The response directly addresses the prompt by checking #incident-response and explicitly stating there are no P1s currently active. It goes above and beyond by providing additional context about other incidents.,4,yes,"The core message (no active P1s) matches the expected response. While it provides additional incident details not in the expected response, it maintains the same semantic meaning about P1 status. Minor difference in not mentioning the channel ID or description.",9
3,who's the current oncall for platform squad,"Looking at the platform-related channels, I found #squad-platform (C05MD9Y10P9) which has 138 members. From the recent activity and channel structure, I can see there are platform-specific channels including #squad-platform-standup and #squad-platform-private. However, I couldn't find a specific current on-call assignment in the recent messages. You might want to check the #squad-prod-ops channel (C06GNEK1N2J) which specifically mentions 'Tag @S08HYMQP205 for prod support' and has on-call related activity.","I see the list of Slack channels, but I don't see a specific channel dedicated to on-call rotations. With the current set of tools available, I cannot directly determine who is the current on-call for the platform squad.

To find out who's currently on-call for the platform squad, I recommend:
1. Checking your team's on-call management system (like PagerDuty or OpsGenie) directly
2. Asking in the `#squad-of-squads` channel or your platform team's dedicated channel
3. Consulting your team's on-call schedule documentation",False,False,5,yes,The response fully addresses the prompt by acknowledging it cannot determine the current oncall and providing appropriate alternative actions. It correctly identifies this as a failure case and offers constructive next steps.,3,no,"While both responses indicate inability to give a direct answer, the expected response provides more specific channel details (including channel IDs and member counts) and mentions specific prod support tags that are missing from the actual response. The general meaning is similar but lacks important specific details.",8
4,look at #help-engineering and count how many issues were raised yesterday,"I checked the #help-engineering channel (C03T907DSKB) which has 28 members and is described as 'Engineering related queries'. Looking at the recent message history, I can see this is the channel where engineering-related questions and issues are raised. Based on the message timestamps and content, there appear to be ongoing technical discussions and support requests, but I'd need to examine more detailed message patterns to give you an exact count for yesterday specifically.","I apologize, but I see that there was an error when trying to get the channel history for #help-engineering. While I can see that the channel exists (C03T907DSKB), I'm unable to retrieve its history at the moment. This could be due to various reasons such as:

1. The channel might have restricted access
2. There might be a temporary API issue
3. The messages might have been archived or deleted

Would you like me to try retrieving the channel history again, or would you prefer to try a different approach to get this information?",True,True,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by acknowledging it cannot count issues from yesterday, explains why (error accessing channel history), and appropriately identifies this as a failure case. It even offers alternative solutions.",2,no,"While both responses acknowledge the channel exists and include its ID, the semantic content differs significantly. The expected response suggests successful access to channel details (member count, description, ongoing discussions) while the actual response indicates an access error and inability to retrieve history.",7
5,can you find ned's message about the AI procurement thing from last month,"I searched for Ned Loneragan (U0483VAPB3Q) in the user list - his title shows as 'Cxnpl'. Looking through recent channel activity, I found several channels where procurement and AI-related discussions typically happen, including #ai-cxnpl, #vendor-management, and #help-third-party-vendors. However, I didn't find the specific AI procurement message from last month in the immediate message history. You might want to search in #vendor-management (C05M44V0N4D) or #ai-cxnpl (C08ATQF7XFF) channels where such discussions are more likely to occur.","I don't see any specific messages from Ned about AI procurement from last month in the provided Slack history. The messages shown are mostly about other topics like security alerts, birthdays, mobile app launches, and MYOB updates.

Would you like me to:
1. Search through other channels?
2. Try searching with different keywords?
3. Look for messages from a different time period?

Or alternatively, you could:
1. Reach out to Ned directly to ask about the message
2. Provide more details about when and where you remember seeing the message

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.",False,False,4,yes,"Response directly addresses the search request, acknowledges inability to find the specific message, and provides constructive next steps. However, it doesn't mention specific channels where such messages might be found, unlike the expected response.",3,no,"While both responses indicate the message wasn't found, the actual response misses key specific details present in the expected response (Ned's ID, relevant channel names/IDs, title). The general approach is similar but lacks the technical specificity of the expected response.",7
6,check if anyone's posted about the mortgage UAT issues today,"I searched through mortgage-related channels including #lnd-mortgages (C06PYPFP10E) which has 77 members, and #mortgages (C055Z8X3CRY). I also checked UAT-related channels like #lend-uat and #uat-deployment-notifications. From the recent activity, I can see these channels are actively used for mortgage-related discussions and UAT coordination, but I'd need to examine more specific recent messages to identify today's UAT issues. The #lnd-mortgages channel appears to be the main hub for mortgage discussions.","Based on the recent messages in the mortgage-related channels, I can see several UAT issues being discussed:

1. LVR (Loan to Value Ratio) Calculation Issue:
- There's an active bug (FFFF-35043) regarding final LVR calculation not accounting for existing liabilities
- A fix has been made to the point in time where LVR is calculated (post-submission)
- There's ongoing discussion about LVR limits on the loan calculator screen

2. Loan Purpose Issue:
- Discussion about not supporting different loan purposes between the property screen and loan calculator screen
- Current behavior blocks users from progressing if purposes are different

3. Document Upload:
- Multiple discussions about document naming and mapping for various types of evidence
- Current behavior allows reuse of previously uploaded documents across sections

4. Ownership and Liability Issues:
- Questions about liability ownership between joint applicants
- Discussion about removing non-applicant options and percentage split declarations

I can check more specific channels or details about any of these issues if you'd like to focus on a particular area. Would you like me to:

1. Look into more details about any of these specific issues?
2. Check for other UAT issues not covered in these messages?
3. Search for specific issue numbers or types of problems?",True,False,2,no,"The response assumes issues exist and lists them without first confirming if anyone actually posted about UAT issues today. The prompt asks to check for posts today, but the response doesn't specify timing of the issues discussed.",1,no,"The expected response shows a process of checking specific channels and acknowledging the need for further investigation, while the actual response jumps directly to listing issues without establishing their recency or source. The semantic meaning is substantially different.",3
7,who's been tagged most in #squad-txb this past week,"I checked the #squad-txb channel (C04FK3NJTPY) which has 137 members. This is one of the most active squad channels based on its member count. Looking at recent activity patterns and the nature of squad channels, team members frequently tag each other for code reviews, incident responses, and project coordination. Based on the general activity level and squad dynamics, the most frequently tagged individuals would typically be the engineering managers, on-call engineers, and product leads within the TXB squad.","I apologize for the confusion in my previous attempt. I see that there was an error because I couldn't find the channel ""#squad-txb"" in the list of channels. This could mean either:

1. The channel name might be different from what was provided
2. The channel might be private and not accessible through the general channel list
3. The channel might have been recently renamed or archived

Could you please:
1. Verify the exact channel name you're looking for
2. Check if it's a private channel
3. Provide the correct channel name if it's different

Once you confirm the correct channel name, I'll be happy to help you check who's been tagged most frequently in that channel.",True,True,4,yes,"The response addresses the prompt by explaining why it cannot provide the requested information and offers steps to resolve the issue. It acknowledges the failure case appropriately, though could have been more explicit about being unable to access tag data.",2,no,"The response takes a different approach from the expected answer, focusing on error handling rather than providing channel statistics and typical tagging patterns. It misses key information about channel ID, member count, and typical squad communication patterns that are present in the expected response.",6
8,find me any mentions of APRA in the compliance channels,"I searched compliance-related channels including #help-legal-risk-compliance (C03SWCHH0SW) which has 101 members and is specifically for 'Legal/risk/compliance related queries'. I also found #controls-implementation (C04BASXKH6D) with 67 members and several other compliance-focused channels. APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority) discussions would typically occur in these channels, especially around regulatory compliance, audit requirements, and banking regulations. The #help-legal-risk-compliance channel would be the primary place for APRA-related discussions.","I see the channels list but was unable to find any specific compliance channels with direct mentions of APRA. However, I notice there are several relevant channels that might contain APRA-related discussions:

1. `help-legal-risk-compliance` (C03SWCHH0SW) - This is the main channel for legal/risk/compliance related queries
2. `controls-implementation` (C04BASXKH6D) - Channel for implementing controls
3. `apra-review-july24` (C074LJ7F76F) - A dedicated channel for APRA review
4. `multitenancy-apra-prep` (C089KH1EQFJ) - Channel related to APRA preparation

Would you like me to search through any of these specific channels for APRA-related discussions? The `apra-review-july24` channel seems particularly relevant as it's specifically dedicated to APRA review.

Let me know which channel(s) you'd like me to search through and I can get more specific information about APRA discussions.",True,True,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by identifying and listing relevant compliance channels where APRA might be mentioned, including specific channel IDs and purposes. It even goes beyond by offering to search specific channels for more detailed information.",4,yes,"The response identifies the same key channels (help-legal-risk-compliance and controls-implementation) with matching channel IDs, and conveys similar semantic meaning about compliance discussions. It adds additional APRA-specific channels not mentioned in the expected response, but maintains the core concept of where APRA discussions would occur. Minor difference in not mentioning member counts.",9
9,check what jeremy smith posted in #all-devs yesterday,"I found Jeremy Smith (U03NB56S24F) in the user directory with the title 'Crab'. Looking at the #all-devs channel (C044CEGHE74) which has 136 members and is described as 'All engineers of the company can be addressed here!', this would be where Jeremy would post engineering-wide communications. Based on the recent leadership changes mentioned in other channels, Jeremy has taken on additional responsibilities as Interim Head of Platform, so his messages would likely relate to platform engineering updates or company-wide technical announcements.","I apologize for the continued errors. Even though I can see both the channel (#all-devs with ID C044429MB6D9) and the user (Jeremy Smith with ID U03NB56S24F), I'm unable to access the channel history due to API limitations or permissions.

The best way to find Jeremy Smith's messages from yesterday in #all-devs would be to:

1. Manually check in Slack by:
   - Opening the #all-devs channel
   - Using Slack's search bar with: `from:@jeremy.smith in:#all-devs after:yesterday before:today`
   - Or scrolling up to yesterday's messages

2. Or reach out to Jeremy directly to ask about his message

- Identity ID: 3f78a053-cedf-4c64-90bd-844e61e6e58e
- Issue: Unable to download PDF report from Equifax

3. **General Updates**
- A new ""Common How-To Guide Prod Support"" has been pinned to the channel for reference
- There are ongoing discussions about various loan applications and consents metadata

The most critical issue appears to be the 5XX errors with the vehicle loan application endpoint, which is currently in an ALARM state. This should be investigated as it could be impacting loan application processing.

If you need to know who has admin access to the channel, I recommend:
1. Contacting your Slack workspace administrator
2. Checking the channel settings directly in Slack's interface
3. Looking for channel management documentation in your organization's IT/security resources",True,True,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the question about admin access in the #access_requests channel, acknowledging the channel's existence and correctly explaining that specific admin access information cannot be determined with available tools. It provides helpful alternative suggestions for finding this information.",4,yes,"The response conveys similar core information about the channel (ID, purpose, membership count with slight variation 166 vs 164).

18,find sean's message about the pen testing schedule,"I found Sean Mysell (U05TUK2P4G7) in the user directory. Looking at penetration testing related channels, I found multiple active pen testing channels: #tmp-signupless-pentest, #tmp-bankers-console-pentest, #tmp-2025-annual-pentesting (C08DY6VH4SV) with 22 members, #tmp-mobile-app-2-0-pentesting, and others. The annual pen testing channel with 22 members suggests it's actively coordinating the 2025 penetration testing schedule. Sean's messages about pen testing would likely appear in these security-related channels.","Let me help find Sean's message about pen testing schedules. Looking through the messages, I can see several relevant discussions about pen testing planning. The most recent and relevant message appears to be from Sean (U05TUK2P4G7) on December 5th, 2023, where he laid out a comprehensive pen testing schedule for 2024:

""Hey all, we are currently talking to our security testing provider to plan for the next year of security testing. Currently, we are looking at 6 big ticket items:
• Annual testing end of next year
    ◦ APIs
    ◦ Mobile Apps & Open Banking Web App
    ◦ Secure code review (core APIs & potentially frontend repos)
• New Core Web App
• Multi-tenancy (review any impacted components, most likely all APIs again)
• Red team assessment""

The message also included details about additional quarterly testing for:
- New third party integrations with protected data flows
- New digital channels
- Changes to authentication mechanisms
- Novel architectural changes
- Increased data classification flows
- New APIs using new design patterns

19,look at #help-hr and see what recruitment questions came up,"I checked the #help-hr channel (C03T8U2909X) which has 205 members and is described as 'HR related queries.' This high-membership channel indicates it's actively used for various HR matters including recruitment questions. I also found recruitment-related channels like #recruiting-process (C04KEBD3DT6) with 26 members for 'managing the recruitment process (e.g. pipeline, Jira notifs, interview stages, roles)'. These channels would contain recruitment questions, hiring process queries, and candidate coordination discussions.","I apologize, but I wasn't able to get the channel history for #help-hr. While I can see that the channel exists (ID: C03T8U2909X) in the channel list, I received an error when trying to access its history. This could be due to permissions restrictions or other technical issues.

Would you like me to:

I also found related data channels like #squad-data (C0725HDAZBN) with 107 members and various data-specific channels. The adhoc requests channel would contain requests for custom data analysis, one-off reporting needs, and special data extractions from various team members across the organization.","I apologize for the error. It seems I don't have access to view the channel history because the bot is not a member of the #data-adhoc-requests channel. 

From the channel list, I can tell you that:
1. The channel was created recently
2. It currently has 9 members
3. It's purpose is presumably for handling ad-hoc data requests

To view the channel history, you would need to either:
1. Add the bot to the channel, or
2. View the channel directly through your Slack client

The hypercare channel with 59 members suggests active post-launch monitoring, while the main project channel has 98 members indicating significant ongoing activity around the MYOB integration project.","Based on the recent Slack messages, here are the key MYOB integration discussions from the past week:

1. **Stats Request (Most Recent)**
- MYOB asked about statistics regarding customer rejections due to unsupported entity types
- This query is currently pending response from team members

2. **Release Notes Timing**
- MYOB requested to receive release notes earlier than UAT deployment for better preparation
- This feedback was passed to the team for process improvement

3. **Customer Access Issues**
- Discussion about a customer being locked out of Solo app after email address change
- Team members are investigating the issue

4. **Release Version Discussion**
- Mentions of version 2.39 for MYOB
- Previous version 2.38 was deployed to UAT

22,check #proj-term-deposits for any blockers mentioned today,"I found the #proj-term-deposits channel (C077PR48H51) which has 67 members, indicating it's an active project with significant team involvement. Term deposits projects typically involve complex regulatory requirements, system integrations, and product development challenges. The channel would contain discussions about project blockers, technical challenges, regulatory compliance issues, and coordination between different teams working on the term deposits feature.","Looking through today's messages in #proj-term-deposits, there are a few potential blockers/issues being discussed:

1. Term Deposit SMS Typo - Someone reported a typo in the term deposit SMS messaging that needs to be fixed.

2. Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) Requirement - There's a note about needing to arrange a PDS if any client offers term deposits longer than 5 years (60 months). Currently, the PRD assumes a max term of two years.

However, neither of these appear to be immediate blockers to the current functionality. The SMS typo is a minor issue that needs correction, and the PDS requirement is more of a future consideration rather than a current blocker.

The most recent messages are primarily focused on product documentation and implementation details rather than highlighting any critical blocking issues.

Would you like me to:
1. Look through earlier messages to check for any other blockers?
2. Get more details about either of these issues?
3. Search for something specific?",True,True,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by checking for blockers mentioned in the specified channel, identifying two potential issues, and clearly stating whether they are considered blockers. It also offers follow-up options for further investigation.",2,no,"The response provides specific details about blockers that aren't mentioned in the expected response.

These channels would contain discussions about control effectiveness, audit findings remediation, and compliance activities across the organization.","Based on the recent messages in the controls-automation-platform channel, there have not been any direct mentions of audit findings this week. However, there have been several important discussions about CAP (Controls Automation Platform) including:

1. Recent CAP-related updates:
- Implementation of new controls for blocklist monitoring
- Updates to CAP query systems
- Discussions about automation of controls
- Changes to how CAP interacts with Jira

2. Most recent activity:
- A request from Meraj regarding adding CAP control for blocklist monitoring with specific queries for:
  - Checking AFCX files download in last seven days
  - Matching number of records in raw AFCX files
  - Monitoring record processing
  - User update monitoring against existing blocklist records

3. Platform Updates:
- Changes to how CAP and Jira communicate
- Updates to notification systems
- Improvements to control automation processes

If you're specifically looking for audit findings, I'd recommend:
1. Checking the #controls-implementation channel directly
2. Reaching out to the controls team or risk & compliance team
3. Checking recent Jira tickets related to audit findings

24,look for cameron's posts about platform architecture changes,"I found Cameron Meindl (U02NVB78XLG) in the user directory with the title 'Field CTO Constantinople'. As the Field CTO, Cameron's posts about platform architecture would likely appear in technical leadership channels, #squad-platform channels, #all-devs, or architecture-specific channels. Given recent platform team leadership changes mentioned in other messages, Cameron's architectural guidance would be particularly important during this transition period.","I've reviewed the recent Slack history but I don't see any direct messages from Cameron about platform architecture changes. The messages shown are mostly about various technical issues and pipeline failures.

To help find what you're looking for, I suggest:

1. Narrowing down the timeframe you're interested in
2. Trying additional channels like:
   - #eng-backend
   - #tech
   - #all-devs
   - #platform-support
   - #operating-model (though this seems to have low activity)

3. If you can provide any specific keywords or topics related to the architecture changes you're interested in, I can do a more targeted search.

Some potential architecture-related discussions I see are about:
- Breaking changes detection in the API
- Handling money across Bosphorus and Acropolis
- Product configuration changes

But none of these appear to be from Cameron specifically about platform architecture changes. Could you provide more context about what kind of architectural changes you're looking for?",False,False,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the task of looking for Cameron's posts about platform architecture changes, acknowledging the search attempt and providing alternative search suggestions.

I also found various production alert channels like #prod-platform-alerts and #alerts-cicd. Database migration alerts would appear in these channels, particularly those focused on production data migration and platform alerts.","Based on my review of the available channels and messages, I don't see any current database migration alerts in the production channels. However, I notice there are several important production monitoring channels that you should keep an eye on:

Key Production Channels:
1. #prod-platform-alerts (C06LWBP2P18)
2. #prod-txb (C071DARNL6T)

8. #prod-changelog-flags (C07P73TBK8C)

The messages I was able to retrieve don't show any current database migration alerts. However, if you're planning a database migration, you should:

1. Monitor these production channels
2. Coordinate with the relevant teams
3. Use the appropriate channels for communication
4. Consider posting updates in #release-notifications (C07045XADC3) for broader visibility

Would you like me to check any specific channel or look further back in the history?",True,True,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the request to check for database migration alerts and provides a clear answer.

26,find the AML/CTF training deadline mentioned in compliance,"Looking at compliance channels, I found #help-legal-risk-compliance (C03SWCHH0SW) and various training-related discussions. From the recent activity in #general, I can see there are training-related communications including mentions of SafeTrac Compliance training. AML/CTF (Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorism Financing) training deadlines would typically be communicated through the legal risk and compliance channels, with reminders sent via email and posted in compliance-focused Slack channels.","Based on the search results, for AML/CTF training, there isn't a single fixed deadline. Instead, training requirements are typically triggered by specific events, as outlined by AUSTRAC:

Training is required when:
1. New methodologies or indicators relevant to your business emerge
2. Employees fail to comply with your AML/CTF program
3. AUSTRAC issues new guidance or feedback on ML/TF risk in your sector
4. AUSTRAC provides feedback on your business' AML/CTF compliance

However, there is one important date to note: From July 1, 2026, new AML/CTF obligations will apply to certain tranche 2 entities. This isn't specifically a training deadline, but rather when new AML/CTF obligations come into effect for certain businesses.

For specific training deadlines, you should:
1. Check your organization's AML/CTF program documentation
2. Consult with your AML/CTF compliance officer
3. Review your organization's training policy, which should specify the frequency of required training updates

Would you like me to provide more information about any specific aspect of AML/CTF training requirements?",False,False,2,no,The response provides general AML/CTF training information but doesn't specifically search for or address finding a deadline in compliance channels as requested in the prompt,1,no,"The response provides completely different content about general AML/CTF requirements, while the expected response specifically discusses finding information in compliance channels and SafeTrac training communications",3

While I can see that the channel exists (C05VA5T1BB6 - major-incident-comms), I received an error when trying to access its messages. This could be due to permissions restrictions or the channel being private.

To get information about the GSB incident, I recommend:

1. Directly checking the #major-incident-comms channel in Slack
2. Reaching out to the incident response team
3. Checking any incident management system that might be tracking this issue

Would you like me to try a different approach to help you get this information?",True,True,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by attempting to check the GSB incident assignments in the specified channel, appropriately acknowledging its inability to do so, and providing alternative suggestions.

Temporal is a workflow engine technology, so these channels would contain discussions about workflow execution issues, system reliability problems, and technical support escalations. The support channel with 35 members suggests active engagement with temporal-related issues and vendor support.","Based on the channel history, there are a few key items to note regarding Temporal vendor-related issues:

1. Vendor Notification Status:
- A vendor notification to GSB was required after Temporal was signed (on Christmas Eve 2024)
- The notification has been completed and sent to GSB (confirmed in a message with reactions)
- The notification document is available at: https://constantinople.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CXNPLPREPROJ/pages/801603640/Vendor+Notification+-+Temporal

2. Important Technical Considerations:
- Temporal is being used for:
  - Lending applications (though not yet in production at the time of discussion)
  - Client webhooks
  - There are plans for broader platform usage

3. Critical Dependency Note:
- An important point was raised about system resilience: While Temporal is a critical dependency (if it's down, workflows won't progress), it has built-in resilience - when the system comes back up, workflows will continue from where they left off.

4. Current Status:
- The vendor notification process appears to be complete
- No current critical issues or escalations are visible in the recent channel history
- The system is being used primarily for lending applications and client webhooks, with potential expansion planned

The main discussion in the channel has been around the vendor notification process rather than any technical escalations. If you need specific information about current technical issues or escalations, you may want to:
1. Check the Temporal dashboard directly
2. Reach out to the platform team members mentioned in the channel
3. Review any related JIRA tickets

Would you like me to look into any specific aspect of these discussions in more detail?",True,True,4,yes,"The response attempts to address escalated issues by providing a comprehensive review of vendor-related discussions and status, though it focuses more on general status than specific escalations.

The resource limit alerts channel specifically deals with AWS resource limits which would include API rate limiting issues. These backend channels would contain technical discussions about API performance, rate limiting configurations, and system scaling challenges.","Based on the Slack history, I can see several important AWS resource limit warnings that relate to rate limits:

1. Parameter Store Limits:
- Current Usage: 17,268 - 22,106 (varying across environments)
- Alerting Threshold: 9,400
- Maximum Allowed: 10,000
- Status: APPROACHING LIMIT in both sandbox and development environments

2. DynamoDB Tables:
- Current Usage: 1,151 - 1,372 (varying across environments) 
- Alerting Threshold: 900
- Maximum Allowed: 10,000

3. S3 Buckets:
- Current Usage: 1,005
- Alerting Threshold: 960 
- Maximum Allowed: 1,000
- Status: VERY CLOSE TO LIMIT

Key Concerns:
1. Parameter Store is significantly over the alerting threshold and approaching the hard limit of 10,000 parameters
2. Many suspected orphaned resources that could be cleaned up
3. S3 bucket count is dangerously close to the maximum allowed limit

Recommendations:
1. Clean up orphaned resources:
   - Remove unused parameter store entries
   - Clean up orphaned DynamoDB tables
   - Delete unused S3 buckets

2. Implement resource management:
   - Add automated cleanup of temporary/test resources
   - Implement naming conventions to better track resource lifecycle
   - Consider implementing resource tagging for better management

3. Monitor and Alert:
   - Keep tracking these metrics through the existing alerting system
   - Consider lowering alert thresholds to provide more time for cleanup
   - Add monitoring for rate of resource creation

34,look at #lending-lrc for any policy questions from this week,"I found the #lending-lrc channel (C06JWR8M43Y) with 17 members. LRC typically stands for Legal, Risk, and Compliance, so this channel would focus on lending-related legal and compliance matters. I also found related channels like #lending-lrc-crossover and #help-legal-risk-compliance. These channels would contain policy interpretation questions, regulatory guidance requests, and compliance-related discussions specific to lending products.","Based on the recent messages in the channels, I can see several policy-related questions and discussions from this week:

1. Account Closure Policy Question:
- There's a question about the notification period for forced account closure
- Currently set at 14 days, but there's a request to amend it to 30 days
- Question whether the 14-day period is legally required

2. Business Continuity Policy:
- Discussion about Maximum Allowable Outage (MAO) thresholds:
  - Payment Processing MAO is 4 hours (including transaction and fraud monitoring)
  - Questions about the 24/48 hour thresholds for certain functions
  - Query about Feedzai RTO being 4 hours vs MAO of 24 hours for Transaction/Fraud monitoring

3. Guarantor Policy:
- Questions about loan guarantor requirements for Pty Ltd companies
- Discussion about where guarantor information is stored and how it's tracked
- Query about whether director guarantors are required for Pty Ltd loans

4. Multiple Loan Applications Policy:
- Question about whether customers can have multiple ongoing loan applications
- Current behavior prevents applying for a Vehicle Loan when an Unsecured Loan is approved but not yet disbursed

5. Credit Check Policies:
- Discussion about when Equifax PreQualifyScore and Full Reports are run in the application flow
- Timing of credit checks in relation to loan submission and serviceability checks

36,find any automation failures mentioned in #guild-cicd-appreciation-club,"I found the #guild-cicd-appreciation-club channel (C096V7TFKTN) which has 14 members. This appears to be a guild focused on CI/CD processes and automation appreciation. CI/CD guilds typically discuss build pipeline issues, deployment automation problems, and continuous integration challenges. The 'appreciation club' name suggests it's both a technical discussion space and a place to recognize good automation practices.","I notice that the channel ""#guild-cicd-appreciation-club"" is not found in the list of channels that was returned.

The 'make tech spend great again' channel name suggests cost optimization discussions, while the main AWS channel with 49 members would contain cost management discussions, resource optimization, and spending analysis.","Based on the channel history, here are the key AWS cost and infrastructure-related discussions:

1. AWS Bedrock/AI Model Usage:
   - Multiple discussions about Bedrock model quotas and throttling limits
   - Requests for increases in token limits for Claude models

As the AI team lead, his messages would cover AI project progress, model deployment updates, and technical implementation milestones.","Based on the messages I can see, Oscar Fawkes' latest significant message about AI implementation was a thread reply to a message about NSW Labor's regulation of AI in workplaces. This was more about regulatory aspects rather than internal implementation progress.

However, there is relevant AI implementation progress information from Jeremy Smith's message about Sonnet 4 token limits being increased by 5x (from ~200K to 1M tokens per minute), which should help resolve rate limiting issues that users were experiencing with larger queries that scraped Confluence/Slack content.

4. **Complex Entities**
- Recent work has been done on fixing complex entities for KYC processes
- This was part of preparation for GSB marketing campaign
- Received positive feedback from client

There don't appear to be any major system-wide KYC process issues, but rather specific edge cases and integration points being worked on. The team appears to be actively monitoring and addressing these issues.
