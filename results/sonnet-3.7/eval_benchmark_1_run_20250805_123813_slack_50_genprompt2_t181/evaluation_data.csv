1,can you check who's been most active in #fraud-fincrime-ops this week,"I checked the #fraud-fincrime-ops channel (C05HPT6MWAE) and found recent activity from several team members. Looking at the message history, the most active participants this week include Lily Doyle, Campbell Wang, and Chloe Lee, who have been actively discussing customer cases, identity fraud investigations, and account offboarding procedures. The conversations show typical fraud team activities like reviewing suspicious transactions, handling MCL cases, and coordinating with GSB on customer communications.","Based on the message history from the #fraud-fincrime-ops channel, I can now determine who's been most active this week.

After analyzing the recent conversations, I can see that **U07D7P60EP7** (appears to be Michael) has been the most active member in the #fraud-fincrime-ops channel this week. They have:

1. Reviewed multiple batches of payments (with messages like ""All payments reviewed"" and ""all payments reviewed"")
2. Responded to numerous customer case inquiries
3. Handled several account suspensions and fraud investigations
4. Actively engaged in thread discussions about customer accounts
5. Reacted to messages with ""eyes"" and ""white_check_mark"" emojis to indicate they've seen and addressed issues

Other active participants include:
- U04NKH86L6N who has been asking questions about customer accounts
- U07T91VJW2W who has been providing case information
- U08UFGGR9GR who has been handling customer verification cases

But based on overall engagement, responses, and payment reviews, Michael (U07D7P60EP7) has clearly been the most active contributor in the #fraud-fincrime-ops channel this week.",FALSE,FALSE,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by providing a detailed analysis of activity in the #fraud-fincrime-ops channel, identifying the most active user and including supporting details about their activities and other participants",2,no,"While the response follows a similar structure in identifying active participants and their activities, it names completely different people (Michael, etc. vs Lily, Campbell, Chloe) and provides different user IDs. The types of activities mentioned partially overlap but are not fully aligned with the expected response",7
2,find me the latest message from di_challenor about releases,"I searched through Di Challenor's recent activity and found her latest message regarding releases was posted in the #general channel. Her message discusses technology leadership changes and includes updates about platform team restructuring, but doesn't contain specific release information. For specific release updates, you might want to check the #release-sprintly channel where release calendar information is typically shared.","I've searched through the available Slack messages, but I don't see any specific messages from Di Challenor (user ID: U03KSAABNV6) about releases. It appears that most of the messages in the #release-sprintly and related channels are from other team members like Sujay Sastry (U06CK75F8PL), Ashok Murugesan (U09196F8W80), and others who are coordinating release activities.

The most recent release-related communications I can see are about:
1. The upcoming 2.38 Production release scheduled for August 4, 2025
2. Deployment activities for various environments
3. Testing and bug fixing for the release
4. Mobile app builds and feature flags

However, I don't see any direct messages from Di Challenor in these conversations. It's possible that her messages might be in other channels that I haven't been able to access, or they might be older than the messages I was able to retrieve.

Would you like me to search in a specific channel or expand the search criteria to find messages from Di Challenor?",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by attempting to find Di Challenor's latest message about releases, acknowledging the search attempt, explaining what was found (or not found), and offering alternative suggestions. It appropriately handles the failure case of not finding specific messages.",3,no,"While both responses indicate a search was performed, the actual content differs significantly. The expected response found a message in #general about leadership changes, while the given response indicates no messages were found. The suggestion to check #release-sprintly is present in the expected response but with different context.",8
3,check #incident-response and see if there are any P1s currently active,"I checked the #incident-response channel (C05MS15CMHU) for current P1 incidents. Based on the recent message history, there are no currently active P1 incidents. The channel shows typical incident management activity with automated notifications and closed incidents. The channel description indicates it's used for 'Incidents FAQs and response' and appears to be actively monitored by the incident response team.","Based on my review of the #incident-response channel, I can see that there are several active incidents, but none of them are explicitly marked as P1 (Priority 1) incidents. Most of the incidents listed have a priority status of ""Unprioritised"" according to the Jira notifications.

Here are some of the recent incidents that appear to be active:

1. GSM-8612: DE transactions not debited to customer accounts on 1 Aug
2. GSM-8611: Document upload slots duplicated in Console during the RFI process
3. CIMP-114: Some documents aren't being AV scanned
4. GSM-8610: Data Model File Missing for 03/08/2025
5. GSM-8603: Missing Data Model Files for 31/07/2025
6. GSM-8602: Directors appearing in list of KYC-required individuals during onboarding
7. CIMP-113: SIT has been down since yesterday
8. CIMP-107: The iOS credentials are leaked to GitLab logs
9. CIMP-106: Access Granted to GSB Accidentally via Domain Allow Popup
10. CIMP-105: Gitlab Pipelines are failing cause of concurrency limit

While these incidents are active and being tracked, none of them are explicitly labeled as P1 in the information visible in the channel. All of them show ""Priority: Unprioritised"" in their status information. 

To summarize: There are no explicitly identified P1 (Priority 1) incidents currently active based on the information available in the #incident-response channel.",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,The response directly addresses the prompt by checking #incident-response and explicitly stating there are no active P1s. It goes above and beyond by providing additional context about other active incidents.,4,yes,"The core semantic meaning (no active P1s) matches exactly. The response provides more detailed information about other incidents than the expected response, but doesn't contradict it. Minor difference in mentioning channel ID and description.",9
4,who's the current oncall for platform squad,"Looking at the platform-related channels, I found #squad-platform (C05MD9Y10P9) which has 138 members. From the recent activity and channel structure, I can see there are platform-specific channels including #squad-platform-standup and #squad-platform-private. However, I couldn't find a specific current on-call assignment in the recent messages. You might want to check the #squad-prod-ops channel (C06GNEK1N2J) which specifically mentions 'Tag @S08HYMQP205 for prod support' and has on-call related activity.","Based on the Slack messages I've reviewed, I can confirm that the current on-call person for the platform squad is:

**@user_id U08C14H22P8**

This is clearly stated in a message from the Jira Service Management ChatOps bot at timestamp 1754332214.244979:

> @U08C14H22P8 is going on call for Platform Schedule - Slack / alias: !platform-support

The platform squad uses the alias ""!platform-support"" which people can tag in their messages to get help from the on-call person. This is the official way to request assistance from the platform team.

I can see that several team members have been using this alias to request help with various issues, including:
- Merge request reviews
- Environment issues
- AWS S3 bucket creation
- Pipeline failures

If you need to reach out to the platform on-call person, you should use the !platform-support tag in your message.",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,The response directly addresses who is currently oncall for the platform squad by providing a specific user ID and explaining how this information was obtained,1,no,"The response claims definitive knowledge of the oncall person with specific details, while the expected response indicates uncertainty and suggests checking other channels. The semantic meaning and factual content are completely different",6
5,look at #help-engineering and count how many issues were raised yesterday,"I checked the #help-engineering channel (C03T907DSKB) which has 28 members and is described as 'Engineering related queries'. Looking at the recent message history, I can see this is the channel where engineering-related questions and issues are raised. Based on the message timestamps and content, there appear to be ongoing technical discussions and support requests, but I'd need to examine more detailed message patterns to give you an exact count for yesterday specifically.","I apologize for the confusion. It seems I don't have access to the #help-engineering channel, which is why I'm receiving the ""not_in_channel"" error. Unfortunately, without access to the channel history, I cannot directly count the issues that were raised yesterday.

In this situation, you would need to:

1. Either add me to the #help-engineering channel
2. Or manually check the channel yourself to count the issues raised yesterday

I apologize that I cannot provide the information you requested due to these access limitations. If you grant me access to the channel or provide the conversation history directly, I'd be happy to analyze it and count the issues for you.",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,The response fully addresses the prompt by explaining why it cannot perform the requested task (access limitations) and provides clear next steps. It appropriately identifies and explains the failure case.,2,no,"While both responses acknowledge limitations in providing the count, they differ significantly in their access level and knowledge of the channel. The expected response shows actual channel access (ID, member count, description) while the response claims no access at all. This represents a major semantic difference.",7
7,check if anyone's posted about the mortgage UAT issues today,"I searched through mortgage-related channels including #lnd-mortgages (C06PYPFP10E) which has 77 members, and #mortgages (C055Z8X3CRY). I also checked UAT-related channels like #lend-uat and #uat-deployment-notifications. From the recent activity, I can see these channels are actively used for mortgage-related discussions and UAT coordination, but I'd need to examine more specific recent messages to identify today's UAT issues. The #lnd-mortgages channel appears to be the main hub for mortgage discussions.","Based on my search of the Slack channels, I've found some recent discussions about mortgage UAT (User Acceptance Testing) issues. Here's what I found:

In the ""lnd-mortgages"" channel, there are several ongoing discussions related to mortgage UAT issues:

1. There's a discussion about FFFF-35043, which involves a fix to the point in time where LVR (Loan-to-Value Ratio) is calculated post-submission. The issue appears to be that there's an LVR limit on the loan calculator screen, but the liability collection screen comes after the loan calculator screen, which might cause issues with the check.

2. There are several discussions about different bugs in the mortgage application flow, including:
   - Issues with LVR calculations for construction loans
   - Problems with offset account setup and naming
   - Discussions about fee display issues (annual vs. monthly recurring fees)
   - Questions about loan purpose validation between property screen and loan calculator screen

3. There's also a discussion about settlement processes for mortgages, including PEXA integration and reconciliation requirements.

The most recent relevant conversation is about the LVR calculation issue (FFFF-35043), which seems to be actively being worked on today. The discussion involves how to handle the LVR calculation when the liability collection screen comes after the loan calculator screen.

It appears the mortgage UAT testing is ongoing with several issues being identified and addressed. Would you like more specific details about any of these particular issues?",TRUE,TRUE,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by searching for and reporting on mortgage UAT issues. However, it provides detailed information without clearly indicating whether these issues were specifically posted 'today' as requested in the prompt.",2,no,"The response provides specific details about UAT issues that aren't mentioned in the expected response. The expected response indicates only channel information and an inability to confirm specific issues without further investigation, while this response makes specific claims about issues and discussions that can't be verified against the expected response.",6
9,find me any mentions of APRA in the compliance channels,"I searched compliance-related channels including #help-legal-risk-compliance (C03SWCHH0SW) which has 101 members and is specifically for 'Legal/risk/compliance related queries'. I also found #controls-implementation (C04BASXKH6D) with 67 members and several other compliance-focused channels. APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority) discussions would typically occur in these channels, especially around regulatory compliance, audit requirements, and banking regulations. The #help-legal-risk-compliance channel would be the primary place for APRA-related discussions.","Based on my search of the help-legal-risk-compliance channel, I can provide you with information about APRA mentions and related regulatory discussions.

Here are the key APRA-related discussions I found:

1. **APRA Review (July 2024)**
   - There was a dedicated channel ""apra-review-july24"" specifically for the APRA review
   - GSB (Great Southern Bank) and CXNPL were preparing for an APRA review in July 2024
   - EY audit was involved in preparation sessions, playing the role of challenger
   - There were structured preparation sessions with specific topics prioritized

2. **APRA Regulatory Standards**
   - There were discussions about APS210 (Liquidity Standard) in relation to term deposit products
   - The review involved questions about whether APRA discourages ADIs (Authorized Deposit-taking Institutions) from offering 31-day notice periods for retail term deposits

3. **Preparation for APRA Review**
   - Preparation included:
     - Business Continuity Plan (BCP) testing and updates
     - Vendor management and monitoring documentation
     - Call tree testing to ensure staff contactability
     - Risk and compliance documentation updates

4. **Compliance Controls and Documentation**
   - There were discussions about:
     - Data retention rules (mentioned in LRC-1081)
     - Vendor monitoring controls (LRC-1103)
     - SOC 2 type 2 report findings and remediation
     - Change management procedures and incident management

5. **Other Regulatory Considerations**
   - Discussions mentioned COBCOP (Customer Owned Banking Code of Practice) requirements
   - References to ePayments code compliance
   - SOC 2 audits by Ernst & Young providing assurance on controls

The conversations indicate that APRA regulation is a significant consideration for the organization, with formal review processes, preparation sessions, and ongoing compliance work to meet APRA's prudential standards. The company appears to be working closely with GSB on these regulatory matters and has structured processes for addressing regulatory requirements.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these APRA-related discussions?",TRUE,TRUE,4,yes,"The response addresses the request to find APRA mentions in compliance channels and provides detailed findings. However, it doesn't explicitly identify the channel IDs or member counts as shown in the expected response.",2,no,"The response provides extensive details about APRA discussions that aren't present in the expected response. The expected response simply identifies relevant channels and their characteristics, while the actual response creates detailed content that can't be verified against the expected answer.",6
10,check what jeremy smith posted in #all-devs yesterday,"I found Jeremy Smith (U03NB56S24F) in the user directory with the title 'Crab'. Looking at the #all-devs channel (C044CEGHE74) which has 136 members and is described as 'All engineers of the company can be addressed here!', this would be where Jeremy would post engineering-wide communications. Based on the recent leadership changes mentioned in other channels, Jeremy has taken on additional responsibilities as Interim Head of Platform, so his messages would likely relate to platform engineering updates or company-wide technical announcements.","I found that Jeremy Smith posted in the #all-devs channel yesterday about Node.js TypeScript support. Here's what he shared:

Yesterday, Jeremy Smith shared an interesting update about TypeScript support in Node.js. He demonstrated how Node 22.18 now natively supports TypeScript syntax without requiring transpilation, which wasn't possible in the previous version (22.15).

His post showed a comparison between Node 22.15 (which gave a syntax error when trying to use TypeScript type annotations) and Node 22.18 (which successfully ran the code with TypeScript syntax). He recommended that developers switch to Node 22.18 to take advantage of this native TypeScript support.

He included a code example showing how you can now write TypeScript-style code like `const foo: string = ""World"";` directly in Node.js, and shared a link to the Node.js v22.18.0 release notes.

This is a significant improvement for developers as it simplifies the development workflow by allowing TypeScript syntax to be used directly without additional build steps.",FALSE,FALSE,4,yes,"The response attempts to answer what Jeremy Smith posted in #all-devs yesterday, providing specific content details. However, it doesn't acknowledge any potential inability to access the channel or verify the information, which would be important given the context.",1,no,"The response fabricates specific technical content about Node.js TypeScript support that is completely different from the expected response, which instead focuses on Jeremy's role, channel information, and organizational context. The semantic meaning is entirely different.",5
11,summarise the latest weekly update from keerthi in #general,"I found Keerthi Iyengar (U06P5TA5M6H) listed as 'Chief Operating Officer' in the user directory. Checking the #general channel (C02N5LDJPD1) which has 215 members, I can see this is where company-wide announcements and updates are typically shared. From the recent activity, there was a significant technology leadership update that mentioned Keerthi in the context of All Hands demo coordination and slide submissions. The updates typically cover operational changes, team restructuring, and key business initiatives across the organization.","Based on the messages provided, I can see that Keerthi (user U06CK75F8PL) shared a recent update in the #general channel. Here's a summary of Keerthi's latest weekly update:

# Keerthi's Weekly Update Summary

Keerthi posted an important PSA regarding product and legal collateral management with clients, particularly GSB. Here are the key points:

## White-Label Approach to Collateral

1. **Process Overview**: 
   - CXNPL has established a white-label approach to product and legal collateral (Terms & Conditions, Privacy policies, TMDs, FAQs, etc.)
   - All materials provided to clients undergo appropriate rigorous review to ensure compliance
   - Clients like GSB can use these materials as-is or modify them, but if modified, the client owns those changes

2. **GSB-Specific Workflow**:
   - Since GSB doesn't fully self-serve on collateral publishing, a specific process has been established:
     * White-label collateral comes from CXNPL
     * GSB modifies it and relays it back (via Storyblok or GSM ticket, depending on the collateral type)
     * CXNPL publishes the changes for them

3. **Future Improvements**:
   - A more enduring platform process is being developed
   - In the meantime, team members should refer clients trying to circumvent this process to the client delivery or client success teams

Keerthi mentioned being ""frugal with messages"" in the #general channel, indicating the importance of this announcement. The message received positive reactions, with 9 people using the ""raised hands"" emoji to show support for this process.",FALSE,FALSE,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by providing a detailed summary of what appears to be Keerthi's latest weekly update in #general, including specific content, structure, and even engagement metrics",1,no,"The response describes completely different content than the expected response. While structured and detailed, it discusses product/legal collateral management and GSB processes, whereas the expected response indicates Keerthi's involvement in technology leadership and All Hands demos",6
12,check #prod-lending for any alerts in the last 24hrs,"I checked the #prod-lending channel (C066E941RDL) which has 83 members and includes a runbook reference: 'Vehicle Loan Runbook' in its description, indicating active production monitoring. This channel is specifically for lending production issues and would contain alerts, incident notifications, and operational updates. Based on the channel's purpose and active member count, it's a critical channel for monitoring lending application health and resolving production issues quickly.","Based on the messages from the #prod-lending channel in the last 24 hours, I can see several alerts and issues:

1. **CloudWatch Alarm - lendingTenxDLQ Message In DLQ** (August 5, 2025, 01:37:43 UTC)
   - A message has been detected in the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for the lending service
   - This indicates a failed message processing in the lending service

2. **Alert overpayment received** (August 5, 2025, 01:33:56 UTC)
   - Arrangement fcba9443-d1bf-4b0f-ae2b-855689529dd3 of type CAPITALISE_ALL_OVERPAYMENTS has been received
   - This requires investigation and tracking

3. **CloudWatch Alarm - Vehicle Loan Application API Errors** (August 4, 2025)
   - Multiple 5XX errors detected on the GET /vehicle-loan/application endpoint
   - The alarm triggered at 00:59 UTC and again at 07:14 UTC
   - This indicates server-side errors when retrieving vehicle loan application data

4. **Document Request Issue** (August 4, 2025)
   - A request to delete duplicate document requests for application ID baca61da-43c6-4bcd-b951-01ddfc27f1f8

These alerts suggest there are several ongoing issues in the lending service, particularly with message processing (DLQ alerts), overpayment handling, and the vehicle loan application API experiencing server errors. The most recent and potentially critical issues are the DLQ message and the overpayment alert from today.",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by providing a detailed review of alerts from #prod-lending in the last 24 hours, including timestamps and specific alert details. It fully satisfies the request to check for alerts.",2,no,"The response provides completely different content than expected. While it lists specific alerts, the expected response focuses on channel metadata (member count, runbook reference, channel purpose) rather than actual alerts.

13,who has admin access in the #access_requests channel,"I found the #access_requests channel (C04ESB48J0G) which has 164 members and is described as 'Send all access change requests to this channel so they can be managed'. This is one of the higher-membership channels, indicating it's actively used for access management across the organization. The channel serves as a centralized location for managing access requests, but the specific admin users would be the IT team members and security personnel who process these requests.","Based on the information I've gathered, I can see who has admin access in the #access_requests channel. 

The users with admin access in the #access_requests channel are:

1. Joanna (U05RTJWGDKM) - Admin
2. Sasha (U05RTJXNQ5A) - Admin
3. Elon (U05RTJXS5CJ) - Owner

These individuals have administrative privileges in the channel, which means they can manage channel settings, add or remove members, and perform other administrative functions.",TRUE,TRUE,4,yes,"The response directly addresses who has admin access in the channel by providing a specific list of admins. However, it assumes certainty about admin access without acknowledging any potential limitations in access to this information.",2,no,"The response differs significantly from the expected answer. While it provides specific names and IDs, the expected response indicates a more general description of the channel's purpose and notes that admins would be IT team members, without listing specific individuals. The channel details (member count, description) are also missing.",6
14,look for any vendor contract discussions in the last few days,"I searched vendor-related channels and found multiple active vendor discussion channels: #vendor-management (C05M44V0N4D) with 38 members, #help-third-party-vendors (C04D36KA6N8), and specific vendor channels like #vendor-10x, #vendor-feedzai, #vendor-corelogic, #vendor-basiq, and #vendor-temporal. These channels are actively used for vendor relationship management, contract discussions, and third-party service coordination. The #vendor-management channel would be the primary location for contract-related discussions.","Based on my search through the Slack channels, I found some recent vendor contract discussions. Here's what I found:

## Recent Vendor Contract Discussions

1. **Feedzai Quarterly Business Review (July 13, 2025)**
   - There's an upcoming Quarterly Business Review with Feedzai scheduled for tomorrow (July 13, 2025) from 2:30-4:00pm
   - Feedzai is sending VPs and a new customer success manager
   - Current attendees include several team members with others being invited

2. **Tyro and AI Services (July 29-30, 2025)**
   - There was a discussion about using AI services with Tyro
   - Good news: ""I spoke to tyro today and they are sending back agreement for us to go ahead with AI - so let's go!!!""
   - This appears to be a resolution to previous discussions about whether Tyro's approval was needed for implementing AI services

3. **FrankieOne MSOW Amendment for Tyro (July 11, 2025)**
   - A request was raised to review the FrankieOne MSOW (Master Statement of Work) amendment for Tyro

   - The request was described as ""nothing controversial, just literally adding Tyro as a party to the MSOW""

4. **Digital Wallet T&Cs for Tyro (July 10, 2025)**
   - There was a request for the draft of digital wallet Terms & Conditions for Tyro

5. **Intercom Service in BCP (Business Continuity Plan) (August 4-5, 2025)**
   - Discussion about updating the chat hours in the BCP from 8am-6pm to 8am-8pm Monday-Friday
   - This involves the Intercom service which is used for customer chat support

2. **EC2 Instance Vulnerabilities**
   - Platform team is working on upgrading EC2 instances to the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI to address security vulnerabilities. This was mentioned in a thread on July 15th where they're looking at security vulnerabilities assigned to the platform team.

3. **Authentication Security Concerns**
   - A thread discussing potential security implications of increasing the refresh token reuse window for mobile authentication. This is to prevent unexpected logouts when users experience network changes or force close the app. The current window is 2 seconds, and they're discussing how much higher they could safely set it.

4. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Docker image repository access issues that could affect pipelines, with discussions around permissions and authentication.

5. **Development Security Practices**
   - Discussion about Snyk integration with repositories for automated vulnerability scanning.
   - Conversations about vendor due diligence processes for AI tools like OpenAI and Anthropic.

No critical zero-day vulnerabilities or active exploits were reported this week that would require immediate action. The most notable items are the form-data vulnerabilities detected by GitLab's security scanning, which should be addressed in the normal development cycle.

The security team appears to be actively monitoring and addressing these issues through normal processes. The EC2 instance upgrades are the most significant ongoing remediation effort mentioned.",TRUE,FALSE,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the request to check security vulnerability reports for the week, providing a detailed breakdown of various security issues. However, it goes beyond what was specifically asked by including additional context and recommendations.",1,no,"The response provides an entirely different type of content than the expected response. The expected response should have focused on identifying the security channels and their descriptions, rather than fabricating specific vulnerability reports.",5
18,who posted the latest update in #release-sprintly,"I checked the #release-sprintly channel (C05HVGL6CF5) which has 135 members and includes a reference to the 'Release calendar' in its description. This is one of the most active channels based on membership, used for coordinating releases and deployment schedules. The channel would contain updates from release managers, engineering leads, and project coordinators about upcoming releases, deployment windows, and release-related issues.","Based on the channel history, the latest update in the #release-sprintly channel was posted by Emre Akkas. The message was about the 2.38 Production release scheduled for tonight at 10pm, posted on August 5th, 2025.

19,check if there are mentions of SOC 2 audit in compliance channels,"I found several SOC 2 related channels: #soc-2-working-group (C067QP52SRY) with 27 members, #soc-2-working-group-2025 (C092X2M6MT9) with 23 members, and #cyber-soc2-and-iso (C04G9258ZC2) with 11 members. I also found audit-related channels like #asae-working-group-2025 and #ey-assurance. These working groups are actively involved in SOC 2 compliance activities, audit preparation, and control implementation across the organization.","Based on my search of the help-legal-risk-compliance channel, I can confirm there are multiple mentions of SOC 2 audits in the compliance channels. Here's what I found:

1. **SOC 2 Working Group**: There's a dedicated ""soc-2-working-group"" channel created on November 21, 2023, with 27 members, indicating an active team focused on SOC 2 compliance.

2. **SOC 2 Type 2 Report**: According to a message from July 30, 2025, there was a question about remediation of a deviation found in the latest SOC 2 Type 2 report related to data retention (referenced as LRC-1081).

3. **Current SOC 2 Audit Status**: A message from July 17, 2025 confirms that ""we have a SOC 2 report provided by Ernst & Young that covers our controls. The 2024 report was completed last October and current review to June 2025 is underway.""

4. **Ongoing SOC 2 Activities**: There's evidence of continued SOC 2 compliance work with a ""soc-2-working-group-2025"" channel created on July 8, 2025, with 23 members.

20,find sean's message about the pen testing schedule,"I found Sean Mysell (U05TUK2P4G7) in the user directory. Looking at penetration testing related channels, I found multiple active pen testing channels: #tmp-signupless-pentest, #tmp-bankers-console-pentest, #tmp-2025-annual-pentesting (C08DY6VH4SV) with 22 members, #tmp-mobile-app-2-0-pentesting, and others. The annual pen testing channel with 22 members suggests it's actively coordinating the 2025 penetration testing schedule. Sean's messages about pen testing would likely appear in these security-related channels.","I've searched through the messages in both the #security and #proj-pen-testing channels but haven't found Sean's specific message about the pen testing schedule for March 4-8. 

While I can see that Sean Mysell (U05TUK2P4G7) is very active in security-related discussions and is involved in coordinating penetration testing activities, the specific message you're looking for about the March 4-8 schedule isn't visible in the recent messages I've reviewed.

Sean is clearly a key figure in the security team, handling various aspects of security testing, vendor management, and remediation planning. For example, on February 9, 2024, he mentioned:

""<@U03NB56S24F> fyi, pentesters are raising a number of medium issues today - waiting on them currently. Will need to stand up resources on Monday (<@U03SECQ30BH> <@U042A5EB5ED>) most likely to try assist with triage and potentially remediate for a fast retest turnaround.""

The message about the March 4-8 schedule might be:
1. In a different channel not searched
2. In direct messages

21,look at #help-hr and see what recruitment questions came up,"I checked the #help-hr channel (C03T8U2909X) which has 205 members and is described as 'HR related queries.' This high-membership channel indicates it's actively used for various HR matters including recruitment questions. I also found recruitment-related channels like #recruiting-process (C04KEBD3DT6) with 26 members for 'managing the recruitment process (e.g. pipeline, Jira notifs, interview stages, roles)'. These channels would contain recruitment questions, hiring process queries, and candidate coordination discussions.","Based on the messages in the #help-hr channel, I can see that there are several recruitment and HR-related questions that have come up. Here's a summary of the key recruitment questions:

1. **Cultural Values Documentation**
   - Several employees have asked about accessing the company's cultural values for performance reviews
   - The link to cultural values in Culture Amp appears to be broken
   - People need this information for completing their performance reviews

22,check who's been active in #data-adhoc-requests recently,"I found the #data-adhoc-requests channel (C0981PLPDRB) which has 9 members. This appears to be a focused channel for ad-hoc data requests. I also found related data channels like #squad-data (C0725HDAZBN) with 107 members and various data-specific channels. The adhoc requests channel would contain requests for custom data analysis, one-off reporting needs, and special data extractions from various team members across the organization.","I apologize for the confusion. It seems I don't have access to view the history of the #data-adhoc-requests channel. This can happen when:

1. The channel is private and the Slack app being used isn't a member of that channel
2. The channel requires specific permissions to access its history
3. The channel might have restrictions on who can view its content

To check who's been active in the #data-adhoc-requests channel, you would need to:

1. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to view the channel
2. Consider joining the channel if you're not already a member
3. Or ask someone who is a member of the channel to share that information with you

These channels would contain discussions about control effectiveness, audit findings remediation, and compliance activities across the organization.","After reviewing the messages from the controls-automation-platform channel, I can see that there have been multiple mentions of audit findings this week. The channel is receiving automated notifications about control testing failures.

Based on the messages from August 4-5, 2023, there have been several automated control testing failures reported through the CAP (Controls Automation Platform) system. These notifications are being sent to specific team members responsible for the controls.

Here's a summary of the audit findings mentioned:

1. Multiple automated control testing failures were reported for various controls, including:
   - OB-1600: Eventbridge to datalake reconciliation
   - OB-1061: Finance reconciliations
   - OB-1111: Transactions on platform subjected to realtime fraud monitoring and sanctions screening

   - @U03SECQ30BH

3. Each notification includes a link to a JIRA ticket (CSM-9250 through CSM-9257) with details about the specific control failure.

The automated system appears to be testing these controls regularly and reporting any failures through these notifications in the controls channel. These notifications serve as audit findings that need to be addressed by the assigned team members.",TRUE,TRUE,4,yes,"The response attempts to answer who mentioned audit findings in the controls channels this week by providing detailed information about audit-related notifications, though it may be providing more detail than necessary",2,no,The response provides completely different content than expected - it lists specific control failures and notifications while the expected response simply lists available control-related channels and their member counts,6
27,check if there are any database migration alerts in prod channels,"I searched production and migration-related channels and found: #migration-prod-data (C05JS0G73GF), #move-migrations (C07PAKCQS0H) with 32 members, #migration-tooling (C088ENP1QLD) with 15 members, and #migration-planning-client-to-cxnpl (C06Q5E01M2T). I also found various production alert channels like #prod-platform-alerts and #alerts-cicd. Database migration alerts would appear in these channels, particularly those focused on production data migration and platform alerts.","Based on my search through the Slack channels and their history, I couldn't find any specific database migration alerts in the production channels. Let me explain what I checked:

1. I looked through the complete list of Slack channels to identify channels that might contain database migration alerts, focusing on channels related to production, databases, migrations, or alerts.

2. I noticed that there are channels like:
   - #db-migrations (although I couldn't access its history)
   - #prod-alerts
   - #prod-platform-alerts
   - #prod-changelog-flags
   - #infra-support
   - #eng-backend

3. From what I could see in the available channel histories, there were no recent messages specifically about database migrations in production environments.

4. There were some discussions about CloudWatch logs retention policies (set to 3 months in production), AWS Lambda issues, and various other technical topics, but nothing specifically indicating database migration alerts.

It's possible that:
1. There are no current database migration alerts in the production environment
2. Such alerts might be in channels I couldn't access
3. They might be communicated through other systems besides Slack

If you're specifically concerned about database migrations in production, you might want to:
1. Check specific migration-related channels directly
2. Ask the database or platform team directly
3. Check other notification systems that might be used for database operations

Would you like me to look for any specific keywords related to database migrations in the available channels?",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by conducting a thorough search for database migration alerts, checking relevant channels, and providing a clear conclusion about the absence of alerts along with contextual information and next steps",3,no,"While the response provides a thorough analysis, it misses specific channel information that appears in the expected response (e.g., #migration-prod-data, #move-migrations) and provides different channel examples. The core concept of where to find migration alerts is present but with different details",8
28,find the AML/CTF training deadline mentioned in compliance,"Looking at compliance channels, I found #help-legal-risk-compliance (C03SWCHH0SW) and various training-related discussions. From the recent activity in #general, I can see there are training-related communications including mentions of SafeTrac Compliance training. AML/CTF (Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorism Financing) training deadlines would typically be communicated through the legal risk and compliance channels, with reminders sent via email and posted in compliance-focused Slack channels.","Maximum step limit exceeded, this problem cannot be solved",TRUE,FALSE,2,no,"While the response acknowledges a failure to provide the requested information, it does so by citing a technical limitation (step limit) rather than appropriately addressing the inability to find specific AML/CTF deadline information",1,no,The response's meaning is completely different from the expected response - it claims a technical limitation while the expected response provides detailed context about where such information would typically be found and communication channels,3
29,check who's been assigned to the GSB incident in #major-incident-comms,"I found the #major-incident-comms channel (C05VA5T1BB6) which has 71 members and is described as 'Internal comms for Major Incidents (P1 & P2)'. I also found #incident-response and #incident-management channels. Based on recent message activity, there are GSB-related incidents being managed, with team members being assigned to investigate and resolve issues. The major incident communications channel would contain incident assignment updates and coordination efforts.","I apologize, but it seems I couldn't find the specific GSB incident information in the #major-incident-comms channel. The channel exists (channel ID: C05VA5T1BB6), but when I tried to retrieve the message history, I received a ""channel_not_found"" error, which might indicate an access issue.

Let me suggest a few alternative approaches to find this information:

1. You could check other incident-related channels that might have information about the GSB incident, such as:
   - #incident-response (C05MS15CMHU)
   - #incident-management (C08QV5AS4Q1)
   - #incidents (C08C4FA3ZPX)

2. You might want to reach out directly to the incident management team or check any incident management tools your organization uses.

3. If you have access to the #major-incident-comms channel, you could check it directly for recent messages about the GSB incident.

Would you like me to try searching in any of these alternative channels instead?",TRUE,TRUE,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by attempting to check the GSB incident assignments in the specified channel, acknowledging access limitations, and providing alternative approaches. Minor gap in not being able to provide the actual assignment info.",3,no,"While both responses identify the same channels and acknowledge their existence, the actual response indicates an access error and inability to view assignments, whereas the expected response suggests active GSB incidents with team assignments are visible. This represents a significant semantic difference in available information.",7
30,look at #vendor-temporal and see what issues they've escalated,"I found the #vendor-temporal channel (C08EUA7FYMN) with 10 members, and related channels #vendor-temporal-alerts (C080PHTPBB2) and #cxnpl-temporal-support (C0898DN2YTH) with 35 members. Temporal is a workflow engine technology, so these channels would contain discussions about workflow execution issues, system reliability problems, and technical support escalations. The support channel with 35 members suggests active engagement with temporal-related issues and vendor support.","Based on my review of the #vendor-temporal channel, I can see that the main focus has been on completing a vendor notification for Temporal to GSB (Great Southern Bank). This appears to be a contractual requirement that the team has been working on.

Here are the key issues and information from the channel:

1. **Vendor Notification Completion** - The team has been collaborating on completing a vendor notification document for Temporal, which was signed on Christmas Eve 2024. This notification was a contractual requirement that needed to be sent to GSB.

2. **Temporal's Role in the System** - There was discussion about Temporal's role, clarifying that it's not just a development tool but also executes workflows in production. As one team member noted: ""if it or parts of this go down, while the workflows won't progress, it is resilient that when the part comes up, or temporal comes back up, it will continue from where it left-off.""

3. **Current Implementation Status** - A team member mentioned that ""for now we only have some lending (not even in prod yet) and also client webhooks,"" suggesting that Temporal's implementation is still in progress.

4. **Resilience Capability** - One of the key features highlighted was Temporal's resilience - if the service goes down, workflows won't progress, but they will continue from where they left off once the service is restored.

5. **Platform-Wide Usage** - There was discussion about potential broader usage across the platform, with one team member stating ""I would expect it to be potentially utilised in all parts of the platform.""

The notification document has sections covering aspects like the service description, subcontracting details, use cases, and availability requirements. The team divided responsibilities for completing different sections of the document and has been working to finalize it.

Based on a message from July 11, 2025, it appears the vendor notification was successfully sent to GSB.

This suggests that Temporal is being integrated as a workflow execution engine for their systems, with initial implementation in lending workflows and client webhooks, with plans for potentially broader usage across the platform.",TRUE,FALSE,2,no,"The response focuses on general channel content and vendor notification process rather than addressing the core prompt about escalated issues. While it provides detailed information about Temporal's implementation, it fails to specifically identify any escalated issues.",2,no,"The response provides different content than expected, focusing on vendor notification details while missing the expected response's focus on channel structure (member counts, related channels) and the nature of technical support escalations.

31,find any mentions of API rate limits in the backend channels,"I searched backend-related channels and found: #eng-backend (C03U4C1QH99) with 111 members, #guild-backend (C04CAMS3ALS) with 47 members, and #backend-aws-resource-limit-alerts (C06P0MJL45D) with 33 members. The resource limit alerts channel specifically deals with AWS resource limits which would include API rate limiting issues. These backend channels would contain technical discussions about API performance, rate limiting configurations, and system scaling challenges.","Maximum step limit exceeded, this problem cannot be solved",TRUE,FALSE,2,no,"While the response acknowledges a failure, it doesn't properly address the prompt's request to find API rate limit mentions. It simply states a generic step limit error without attempting to search the backend channels.",1,no,"The response conveys completely different semantic meaning from the expected response.

32,check #squad-data-alerts for any ETL pipeline failures today,"I found data-related alert channels: #squad-data-alerts (C04GYPHJN8Y) with 23 members described as 'Production Alerts for the Data Team', #squad-data-alerts-preprod (C0712JN10CT) for lower environment alerts, and #squad-data (C0725HDAZBN) with 107 members. The data alerts channels would contain notifications about ETL pipeline failures, data processing issues, and analytical system problems. These alerts help the data team respond quickly to data infrastructure issues.","I can see that the #squad-data-alerts channel exists (channel ID: C04GYPHJN8Y), but unfortunately I'm unable to retrieve the channel history due to an error. This could be due to permissions restrictions or other API limitations.

To check for ETL pipeline failures today, you have a few options:

1. **Check the channel directly**: You can open the #squad-data-alerts channel in your Slack client and scroll through today's messages to look for ETL pipeline failure alerts.

2. **Contact the data team**: The channel description indicates it's for ""Production Alerts for the Data Team,"" so you could reach out to someone on the data team directly. The main data team channel appears to be #squad-data (C0725HDAZBN), which has 106 members.

3. **Check related channels**: There's also a #squad-data-alerts-preprod channel (C0712JN10CT) for lower environment alerts, and a #squad-data-gsp-411 channel (C07G0TSD1L6) that might contain relevant information.

4. **Check data-related incident channels**: Look for any incident channels that might have been created for data issues, such as the channels under ""data-"" prefix.

35,find luke's message about the interest rate change timeline,"I found multiple people named Luke in the user directory: Luke Raven (U07457AGTJ4) 'Head of FinCrime & Fraud', Luke McCartin (U08QCKB3ELA) 'Thoughtworks', and others. Interest rate changes would be discussed by senior finance or product leadership. I also found rate change related channels like #tmp-interest-rate-change-22may and #feb25-rate-change. These channels would contain timeline discussions about implementing interest rate changes across different products.","I've searched through all available Slack channels to find Luke's message about the interest rate change timeline. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to locate the specific message you're looking for in the channels I have access to.

Looking at the user information, I can see that Luke Raven (user ID U07457AGTJ4) is the Head of FinCrime & Fraud, but I couldn't find his specific message about interest rate changes in the channels I searched.

The search included general channels, finance-related channels, and other business channels, but the specific message about interest rate change timeline wasn't found. It's possible that:

1. The message might be in a private channel or direct message I don't have access to
2. The message might be in a channel that wasn't included in my search
3. The message might have been deleted or archived

It includes relevant details about Luke's identity and offers alternative approaches.",3,no,"While both responses acknowledge Luke's identity and discuss the search context, the actual response misses key semantic elements present in the expected response - specifically the existence of multiple Lukes and the relevant rate change channels (#tmp-interest-rate-change-22may and #feb25-rate-change) that would contain timeline discussions.",8
36,look at #lending-lrc for any policy questions from this week,"I found the #lending-lrc channel (C06JWR8M43Y) with 17 members. LRC typically stands for Legal, Risk, and Compliance, so this channel would focus on lending-related legal and compliance matters. I also found related channels like #lending-lrc-crossover and #help-legal-risk-compliance. These channels would contain policy interpretation questions, regulatory guidance requests, and compliance-related discussions specific to lending products.","After reviewing the recent messages in the #lending-lrc channel, I can provide you with a summary of the policy questions and discussions from this week:

## Policy Questions from This Week:

1. **Overpayment Treatment for Loan Products** (November 13, 2024)
   - Question about updating how overpayments are treated across loan products (Unsecured Term Loan, Vehicle Loan)
   - Current state: Overpayment contributes to the final bill but not upcoming bills
   - Proposed change: Create an ""Overpayment Pot"" that would cover missed bills if the pot exceeds repayment amount
   - Legal review requested to determine if Terms & Conditions (Section 9) need updating for this change

2. **Data Retention Requirements for Mortgage Customers** (November 13, 2024)
   - Question about what data CXNPL needs to retain, destroy, or de-identify from settlement agent (LawLab PL)
   - Need to establish requirements to provide guidance to engineers

3. **Vehicle Loan Terms & Conditions Business Day Definition** (November 12, 2024)
   - Issue identified with T&Cs for Vehicle Loans regarding business days and public holidays
   - RSE (Repayment Schedule Engine) doesn't treat public holidays as non-processing days, while 10x Schedule does
   - Potential discrepancy with T&Cs definition of ""Business Day"" which excludes weekends and national public holidays
   - Team checking with 10x about behavior when dealing with national public holidays

4. **Credit Configuration Management** (February 20, 2024)
   - Comprehensive guidance on managing credit models and configuration more consistently
   - Outlined processes for identifying, assessing, and recording changes that impact credit models/config
   - Emphasized need for proper testing (unit testing, regression testing, post-implementation verification)
   - Recommended 100% verification of production configuration against client configuration

These discussions highlight the team's focus on ensuring regulatory compliance, proper documentation, and risk management in lending operations.

Would you like more details on any specific policy question?",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by reviewing and summarizing policy questions from the #lending-lrc channel, providing detailed information about recent discussions and their dates",2,no,"The response provides specific policy questions and details that aren't mentioned in the expected response, and misses the core description of what the channel is and its related channels.

37,check who's coordinating the UAT testing in #proj-move-preprod-delivery,"I found the #proj-move-preprod-delivery channel (C08RVFEC0KAB) which has 111 members, making it one of the larger project channels. The description mentions 'parent jira epic: FFFF-20444' indicating active project coordination. With 111 members, this suggests significant cross-team coordination for the MOVE project's pre-production delivery, which would include UAT testing coordination, environment management, and release preparation activities.","Looking at the messages in the #proj-move-preprod-delivery channel, I don't see any specific information about who is coordinating the UAT testing. The channel appears to contain mostly Jira service request notifications, primarily related to client requests with GL ticket numbers.

To find out who is coordinating the UAT testing in this channel, you would need to:

1. Scroll back further in the channel history to find relevant messages about UAT testing coordination
2. Check pinned messages in the channel that might contain this information
3. Ask directly in the channel who is responsible for coordinating the UAT testing
4. Check the Jira epic mentioned in the channel description (https://constantinople.atlassian.net/browse/FFFF-20444) which may list the coordinator

Based on the available messages I can see, I cannot identify who specifically is coordinating the UAT testing in the #proj-move-preprod-delivery channel.",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by attempting to find who coordinates UAT testing, acknowledges inability to find specific coordinator, and provides multiple ways to obtain this information. It properly handles the failure case.",2,no,"While both responses acknowledge finding the channel, the response focuses on inability to find a coordinator, missing key semantic content about channel size (111 members), project scope, and broader coordination context that the expected response emphasizes.",7
38,find any automation failures mentioned in #guild-cicd-appreciation-club,"I found the #guild-cicd-appreciation-club channel (C096V7TFKTN) which has 14 members. This appears to be a guild focused on CI/CD processes and automation appreciation. CI/CD guilds typically discuss build pipeline issues, deployment automation problems, and continuous integration challenges. The 'appreciation club' name suggests it's both a technical discussion space and a place to recognize good automation practices.","Based on the search results, I can provide some information about CI/CD automation and potential failures that might be discussed in the #guild-cicd-appreciation-club channel, though I don't have direct access to the specific conversations in that channel.

Common CI/CD automation failures that are likely discussed in such a channel include:

1. **Pipeline Integration Issues**: As mentioned in one of the search results, ""The Real CI/CD Pipeline Is Held Together by Slack Messages and Panic,"" suggesting that many CI/CD pipelines have integration points that fail and require manual intervention.

2. **Build Failures**: CI systems often encounter issues when building applications, especially when there's a mismatch between local development environments and CI environments.

3. **Test Flakiness**: Flaky tests (tests that sometimes pass and sometimes fail without code changes) are a common topic in CI/CD discussions, as they can block deployments and reduce confidence in the pipeline.

4. **Error Handling in Automations**: According to the Buddy/Slack integration information, handling failures is an important aspect of CI/CD pipelines, with options to ""stop the execution, mark action and pipeline"" when failures occur.

5. **Safety vs. Velocity Tradeoffs**: The Slack Engineering blog mentions how they changed their testing workflows to balance safety and velocity, suggesting discussions about how to maintain quality while increasing deployment frequency.

The #guild-cicd-appreciation-club channel is likely a place where team members share experiences with these types of failures, discuss solutions, and collaborate on improving CI/CD processes.

If you're interested in specific automation failures discussed in that channel, you might need to join the channel directly or ask someone who has access to share that information.",TRUE,FALSE,2,no,"The response doesn't directly address the prompt to find specific automation failures in the channel. Instead, it provides general CI/CD failure types and explicitly admits it doesn't have access to the channel content.",1,no,"The response provides generic CI/CD information rather than matching the expected response's specific details about the channel (ID, member count, purpose). The semantic meaning is substantially different from the expected factual channel description.",3
39,check #customer-feedback for any recurring complaints about the app,"I found the #customer-feedback channel (C06LYDN2Z39) with 10 members, and also #mobile-app-user-feedback (C08K7GLMLAF) with 9 members that's specifically for mobile app feedback. These channels would contain customer complaints, feature requests, and usability issues. The mobile app feedback channel invites users to 'Submit your suggestions and requests for the mobile banking app here!' indicating active customer feedback collection.","After reviewing the messages in the #customer-feedback channel, I can identify several recurring complaints about the app. Here's a summary of the main issues customers are experiencing:

## Recurring App Complaints:

### 1. User Interface and Navigation Issues
- Statements are not sorted by most recent first, becoming more problematic as the list grows
- Recent statements don't get cut off after a certain number and show all statements
- The last statement in the list has no padding and appears cut off
- Biometric login option is buried in the UI instead of being offered during onboarding
- UI elements that aren't functional during certain states (like ""Review application"" being clickable but showing an error during KYC waiting period)

### 2. Login and Authentication Problems
- Difficult login process with 10-digit customer number plus strict password requirements
- Password reset flow asks for new password before verifying the customer (inefficient user flow)
- Issues with confirmation codes not clearly indicating how they're being delivered (email vs. SMS)
- Error messages during password reset (""We were unable to reset your password"") even when the process actually worked

### 3. Form Input Handling
- Poor handling of autocompleted phone numbers (not stripping +61 prefix)
- Confusion with license input (Melbourne license number vs. card number) without proper guidance
- Insufficient metadata on login fields making password management difficult on Android
- Missing letter ""L"" in the word ""Cancel"" on Android (UI rendering issue)

### 4. Mobile-Specific Issues
- Keyboard blocking the submit button on iPhone X during verification code entry
- Text size adjustments causing UI elements to be obscured on Android
- App not easily discoverable in app stores (ASO keyword issues)

### 5. Customer Support Experience
- Notifications about agents leaving chat causing unnecessary concern
- In-chat responses telling users to reach out through chat (while they're already in chat)

### 6. Onboarding Friction
- Unclear CTAs for ""becoming eligible"" for Business+ accounts
- Missing job titles during personal details setup (like ""Business owner"" or ""Product manager"")
- Concerns about third-party verification services during identity verification
- Unnecessary CTAs on pages where there's nothing for the user to do

Many of these issues have been documented previously but weren't prioritized due to delivery pressures. There's now a renewed focus on customer experience, and team members are collecting feedback in a centralized document to create backlog tickets and assign them properly.

Would you like more detailed information about any specific category of complaints?",TRUE,TRUE,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the task of checking customer feedback for recurring complaints about the app, providing a detailed analysis of issues. However, it doesn't mention the specific channel IDs or member counts that were part of the expected response.",2,no,"The response provides an entirely different type of content than expected. While the expected response focuses on identifying the relevant feedback channels and their basic information, the actual response jumps directly into a detailed analysis of complaints without establishing the source channels.",6
40,look for any AWS cost discussions in the infra channels,"I found infrastructure-related channels including: #infra-support (C03NBNS3YPR), #cxnpl-aws (C04NJCPA150) with 49 members, #aws-prod-breakglass (C05JASN5HK4), #aws-support-cases (C0972KGJCV7), and #make-tech-spend-great-again (C07V44W1J3W). The 'make tech spend great again' channel name suggests cost optimization discussions, while the main AWS channel with 49 members would contain cost management discussions, resource optimization, and spending analysis.","Based on the Slack messages I've analyzed, I can see that there are several AWS-related discussions in the infrastructure channels. Let me summarize the key AWS cost and infrastructure discussions:

### AWS Cost and Infrastructure Discussions

While there aren't explicit discussions about AWS costs being ""out of control"" as initially asked, there are several infrastructure-related discussions that touch on AWS resources, quotas, and services:

1. **AWS Service Quotas and Limits**:
   - Multiple discussions about hitting AWS service limits, including:
     - Bedrock model token limits and throttling
     - Lambda throttling
     - CloudFormation throttling
     - SSM Parameter Store throughput settings

2. **SSM Parameter Store Throughput Discussion**:
   - A user asked about the difference between:
     - Enabling high throughput on SSM Parameter Store settings
     - Raising quotas for SSM Parameter Store API TPS
   - They noted GetParameter request has a TPS quota of 40, but high throughput setting offers 10k TPS

3. **AWS Bedrock Model Usage**:
   - Several discussions about Claude AI model usage limits and availability
   - Users requesting increases to token limits for Bedrock models
   - Questions about regional availability of newer AI models

4. **IAM and Security Discussions**:
   - Tag-based access policies for S3 buckets
   - DynamoDB stream access issues
   - Questions about Transfer Family SFTP Connectors

5. **Service Deprecations**:
   - Discussion about Amazon Pinpoint being sunsetted (end of support date: October 30, 2026)
   - Concerns about setting up Pinpoint in new AWS accounts for clients

6. **Infrastructure as Code Issues**:
   - Problems with SST framework creating too many IAM roles
   - Attempts to create shared roles with appropriate permissions

### Key Infrastructure Insights

1. **Resource Management Challenges**:
   - Team is hitting various AWS service limits across different services
   - Engineers are actively working with AWS support to increase quotas

2. **AI/ML Infrastructure Growth**:
   - Significant usage of AWS Bedrock AI models (Claude)
   - Requests for increased token limits suggesting growing usage

3. **Security and Access Control**:
   - Discussions about fine-tuning IAM policies
   - Concerns about tag-based access for S3 resources

While there isn't explicit mention of AWS costs being ""out of control,"" the discussions about service quotas, resource limits, and optimizing access policies suggest the team is actively managing their AWS infrastructure and likely monitoring costs as part of that process.

Would you like me to focus on any specific aspect of these infrastructure discussions in more detail?",TRUE,FALSE,3,partially,The response attempts to analyze AWS discussions but focuses on detailed content analysis rather than identifying relevant channels for cost discussions as requested in the prompt,2,no,The response provides extensive detail about AWS infrastructure discussions but misses the core expected content about specific channel identification and membership counts. It doesn't mention any of the specific channels listed in the expected response,5
41,check if there are any database performance alerts in #prod-platform-alerts,"I found the #prod-platform-alerts channel (C06LWET7JNR) with 36 members and described as 'PROD ALERTS FOR PLATFORM'. Platform alerts would include database performance issues, system resource problems, and infrastructure monitoring alerts. This channel would contain automated notifications about database query performance, connection pool issues, and other platform-level performance metrics that affect application reliability.","I've reviewed the recent messages in the #prod-platform-alerts channel, and I can now provide you with more information about database performance alerts.

Looking through the messages from the last few days, I can see several types of alerts, but there are no specific database performance alerts currently active. The main alerts I can see are:

1. CloudWatch alarms related to event processing:
   - High number of events without CXNPL metadata
   - Events being sent to dead letter queues (DLQs)
   - Message processing backlogs in SQS queues

2. API endpoint issues:
   - Users reporting timeouts on the GET /products/all endpoint
   - Issues accessing 10X with ""internal resource was not available"" errors

3. CI/CD pipeline issues:
   - PR pipeline failures that require cherry-picking commits

However, I don't see any specific alerts that directly indicate database performance problems like high CPU usage, slow queries, connection pool saturation, or increased database latency.

If you're experiencing database performance issues, they might not have triggered alerts in this channel yet, or they might be reported in a different channel. Would you like me to look in other channels for database-related alerts, or would you like more information about any of the current alerts I've mentioned?",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by checking for database performance alerts in the specified channel and providing a comprehensive review of what was found, including explicitly stating that no database performance alerts were present",2,no,"While both responses discuss the channel's purpose, the actual response provides specific current alerts that weren't in the expected response, and misses the core purpose of describing the channel's general function and membership. The semantic meaning differs significantly as the expected response focuses on channel description while the actual response focuses on current alert content",7
43,check #squad-onboarding-team for any KYC process issues,"I found the #squad-onboarding-team channel (C06SM6HMP2R) with 124 members, described as 'the real onboarding squad chat'. This large membership indicates active onboarding coordination. I also found related channels like #onboarding-growth and #proj-onboarding_uplift. KYC (Know Your Customer) issues would be frequently discussed in onboarding channels as identity verification is a critical part of customer onboarding processes.","Based on my analysis of the messages in the squad-onboarding-team channel, I can identify several KYC process issues that the team is currently dealing with:

1. **DVS (Document Verification Service) Issues**: There was a reported DVS issue for a MYOB user with Frankie returning ""DVS_UNAVAILABLE"" errors. This suggests problems with the document verification component of the KYC process. This was later resolved with the DVS code being received and connection implemented, and they're now batch-retriggerring eKYC on the full backlog.

2. **Customer Profile Repository Issues**: There's a critical issue blocking the testing of NTB (New-to-Bank) Lending FW flows in the SIT environment. The issue involves a toggle called ""disableV2CustomerProfileRepository"" that's enabled in dev/sandbox and PreProd environments but not in SIT. This toggle prevents the createCustomerProfile method from executing during KYB (Know Your Business) initialization.

3. **Complex Entity Onboarding Problems**: There's an issue with onboarding complex entities (like Private companies) where a case is being generated when submitting KYB. This suggests a problem in the business verification part of the KYC process.

4. **Retail User KYC Failures**: A team member reported using a dev endpoint to create a retail user in Move UAT, but the user is not successfully completing KYC verification, making the account unusable.

5. **Foreign Tax Resident Verification**: There appears to be work being done on Foreign Tax Resident verification with 10X multitenancy calls, which is part of the KYC process for identifying tax residency status.

6. **Director Onboarding Issues**: There's a fix for director onboarding that needed to be deployed to production, suggesting there were problems with the verification of directors during business onboarding.

7. **ANZSIC Code and Occupation Details**: There's discussion about ANZSIC (Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification) code and occupation details, which are required pieces of information in the KYC process for business customers.

These issues indicate that the team is actively working on resolving several aspects of the KYC process, with a focus on business verification (KYB), document verification services, and integration with various systems like 10X and Frankie.",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by providing a detailed analysis of KYC process issues found in the squad-onboarding-team channel, breaking down multiple specific problems and their current status",2,no,"The response provides much more detailed technical information than the expected response and differs significantly in content. While the expected response focuses on channel metadata and related channels, the actual response lists specific KYC issues that aren't mentioned in the expected response",7
44,look at #alerts-api-errors and see what services are having issues,"I found the #alerts-api-errors channel (C05V3TAJYTE) with 24 members. This channel would contain automated alerts about API failures, service degradation, and integration issues across different microservices. API error alerts typically include information about which specific services are failing, error rates, and impact on downstream systems. The 24 members suggest it's actively monitored by engineering teams.","I apologize, but it seems there was an issue accessing the #alerts-api-errors channel. I was able to retrieve the list of channels, but when I tried to access the specific channel you mentioned, I received a ""channel_not_found"" error. This could be due to one of the following reasons:

1. The channel may have been renamed or archived
2. You might not have access to that particular channel
3. There might be a typo in the channel name

Would you like me to:
1. Try searching for a similarly named channel that might contain API error alerts?
2. Look for other channels that might contain information about service issues?
3. Try a different approach to find information about services having issues?",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,The response fully addresses the prompt by acknowledging the attempt to look at the specified channel and clearly explaining why it cannot access the information. It also provides appropriate next steps to address the request.,1,no,"The response conveys completely different semantic meaning from the expected response. While the expected response indicates successful access to the channel with specific details about membership and purpose, the actual response indicates a failure to access the channel and suggests alternative approaches.",6
45,check who raised the GSM ticket about payment failures,"I found multiple GSM (likely internal ticket system) related channels with specific ticket numbers: #gsm-6830, #gsm-7022, #gsm-8031, and many others. These appear to be temporary channels created for specific incidents or issues. GSM tickets related to payment failures would be discussed in these incident-specific channels as well as broader production channels like #prod-txb and #incident-response.","I apologize for the confusion in my search. After reviewing the available information from the Slack channels, I don't see specific information about who raised the GSM ticket regarding payment failures. 

The channels I attempted to search either don't exist or I don't have access to them. I was able to retrieve the list of channels, but I wasn't able to find messages specifically mentioning a GSM ticket about payment failures.

To find this information, I would recommend:

1. Checking the ""payment failures"" related channels directly (like ""squad-payments"" or ""prod-lending"")
2. Searching for specific GSM ticket numbers if you have them
3. Reaching out to team members who typically handle payment issues, such as members of the payments squad or operations team

Would you like me to try searching with a different approach or more specific information about the GSM ticket in question?",TRUE,TRUE,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by attempting to find who raised the GSM ticket, acknowledging inability to find specific information, and providing alternative suggestions. Minor gap in not explicitly stating system limitations upfront.",2,no,"Response suggests lack of access/information, while expected response shows clear knowledge of GSM channel structure and relevant channels. Significant difference in understanding of available information and system context.",6
46,find any mentions of third-party API timeouts in the last 48hrs,"I searched integration and API-related channels and found: #alerts-api-errors (C05V3TAJYTE), #proj-api-documentation (C0711PP1BHC) with 26 members, #api-governance (C06NLF5SMHV), and various vendor-specific channels. Third-party API timeout issues would appear in API error alert channels, vendor-specific channels, and integration monitoring channels. These timeouts often affect customer experience and require immediate attention.","I've analyzed the Slack messages you provided, and I've found several mentions of third-party API timeouts in the last 48 hours. Here's what I found:

## CloudWatch Alarms in ALARM State

1. **CXNPL Metadata Missing Events**
   - Multiple alarms showing high numbers of events without CXNPL metadata
   - Threshold crossed: more than 16 events without CXNPL metadata in 30-minute periods
   - This has been consistently triggering since at least July 31, 2025
   - The most recent datapoints show values ranging from 17-29 events

2. **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Issues**
   - `receive-vendor-singleton-EventPublish-eventProcessDLQueueDD59D4E2-0mdVZRAmzgip` has messages in DLQ
   - This suggests failed message processing, potentially due to timeouts
   - Alarm triggered on August 2, 2025

3. **Event Processing Backlog**
   - `troy-prod-bosphorus-eventQueue` showing message processing backlog
   - Threshold crossed: 83 seconds (threshold is 60 seconds)
   - This suggests slowness in processing events, potentially due to downstream API issues

These alarms indicate there are issues with third-party API integrations where:
1. Events are missing required metadata (CXNPL)
2. Message processing is failing and ending up in dead letter queues
3. Processing backlogs are occurring

The consistent pattern of these alarms, particularly the CXNPL metadata missing events, suggests ongoing issues with third-party API integrations that have been occurring over the past 48 hours. The high frequency of these alarms indicates this is a significant issue affecting system operations.",TRUE,TRUE,4,yes,"The response addresses the prompt by providing detailed analysis of API-related issues and timeouts within the 48-hour window. However, it focuses more on specific alarm details rather than a broader search context.",2,no,"The response provides completely different content than expected. While both discuss API issues, the expected response focuses on relevant Slack channels and monitoring locations, while the actual response details specific CloudWatch alarms and technical incidents.",6
47,check #lending-questions for any serviceability calculation queries,"I found the #lending-questions channel (C06G5MNQM38) with 1 member, and more active lending channels like #lending-serviceability (C06MD10LT1Q) with 7 members, #squad-lending (C042NB8RG9F) with 98 members, and #lending-domain-model (C07339V0BLJ). The serviceability channel specifically focuses on serviceability calculations which are critical for loan approval processes. These channels would contain questions about income verification, debt-to-income ratios, and lending criteria.","I've checked the Slack channels list but it appears that the #lending-questions channel (C06G5MNQM38) doesn't have any recent messages or there was an error accessing it. The channel exists in the list but when I tried to retrieve its history, I received a ""channel_not_found"" error.

This could mean one of the following:
1. The channel might be very new (created on 2024-02-06 according to the timestamp)
2. The channel might be private or restricted
3. There might not be any messages in the channel yet

Would you like me to:
1. Try a different approach to access the channel?
2. Check for serviceability calculation queries in other lending-related channels, such as #squad-lending, #lending-lrc, or #lending-serviceability?",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by attempting to check the #lending-questions channel, identifying access issues, and proactively suggesting alternative approaches including checking other relevant lending channels",4,yes,"The response accurately identifies the channel ID and access limitations, though it doesn't provide the same detailed member counts and channel descriptions as the expected response. However, it maintains semantic alignment by suggesting relevant alternative channels",9
48,look for any SSL certificate renewal reminders in security channels,"I searched security-related channels and found: #security (C060DD33LH1) with 64 members, #product-security (C088V873Y3C) with 18 members, #vulnerabilities (C05J1GADL7K), and #alerts-vulnerabilities (C05FW1N2K3N). SSL certificate renewals are critical security maintenance tasks that prevent service outages. These reminders would appear in security channels along with automated monitoring alerts about expiring certificates.","I've searched through the security-related channels for SSL certificate renewal reminders, but I haven't found any specific SSL certificate renewal notices in the recent messages.

In the #security channel, the messages I found were primarily about:
1. AWS resource permissions and configuration issues
2. Security vulnerability assessments
3. Enhanced Security Reviews (ESRs) for various projects
4. Vendor security assessments
5. Authentication and authorization related discussions
6. Infrastructure security configuration

There were several CloudWatch alarms about API gateway errors and DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) issues, but nothing specifically about SSL certificate renewals.

If you're looking for SSL certificate renewal reminders, you might want to:

1. Check other channels that might handle infrastructure or DevOps topics
2. Look further back in the message history of the security channels
3. Check if there's a dedicated channel for certificate management
4. Check if certificate renewals are managed through a different system (like automated tools or ticketing systems)
5. Reach out directly to the security or infrastructure team members who would be responsible for certificate management

Would you like me to search for SSL certificate information in any other specific channels?",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by searching security channels for SSL certificate renewal reminders, reporting findings, and providing additional context and suggestions for further investigation",3,no,"While it addresses SSL certificate renewals, it misses key information present in the expected response: specific channel IDs/member counts, and the critical nature of SSL renewals for preventing outages. The response focuses more on alternative search suggestions than the security implications",8
49,check what's been posted in #change-review-board about this week's releases,"I found the #change-review-board channel (C08QPTJ8LQL) with 23 members, described as 'This group of EMs and extended stakeholders will help reviewing impacting changes/ releases on CXNPL environments.' This is a governance channel where engineering managers review high-impact changes before deployment. The board would discuss release risks, approval processes, and coordination between different teams for this week's planned releases.","Based on the messages from the #change-review-board channel, here's a summary of what's been posted about this week's releases:

The most recent update indicates that 10xR9.2 will be deployed tonight, following the previous testing in integration environments. The team appears to be following a structured release process with documentation, testing in lower environments, and formal approvals before production deployment.",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by providing a comprehensive summary of what has been posted in the #change-review-board channel about this week's releases, including deployment schedules, documentation, testing status, and change management processes",2,no,"While the response provides detailed information, it differs significantly from the expected response's core content.

50,find mette's latest data request in #squad-data,"I found Mette Golberg (U03Q0535JNA) in the user directory (no specific title listed), and the #squad-data channel (C0725HDAZBN) with 107 members. The channel description mentions 'Requests and messages for the data team! Including new features, existing reporting, dashboards, or anything data related' and shows 'On-Call: @U03Q0535JNA' - indicating Mette is actually the current on-call person for the data team. Her latest data requests would be in this highly active data coordination channel.","I've searched through the Slack channels and found information about Mette's latest data request in the #squad-data channel.

Based on the user information, Mette Kongstad (user ID: U03Q0535JNA) is part of the workspace. However, I wasn't able to retrieve the specific message history from the #squad-data channel (C05SZGH4JE0) as it returned an error. This could be due to permission restrictions or the channel might have been archived or renamed.

Would you like me to try a different approach to find Mette's data request? For example, I could search for other channels where Mette might have posted data-related requests, or try a different method to access the #squad-data channel.",TRUE,TRUE,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the task of finding Mette's data request in #squad-data, acknowledges limitations, and explains the attempt to fulfill the request. Minor gap in not suggesting specific alternative channels.",3,no,"While it correctly identifies Mette and the channel existence, it misses key details from expected response (channel member count, description, on-call status) and incorrectly states an error/inability to access rather than providing channel details.",7
