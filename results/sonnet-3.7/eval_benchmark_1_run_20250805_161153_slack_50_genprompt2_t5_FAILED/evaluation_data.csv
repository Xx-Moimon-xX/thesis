2,find me the latest message from di_challenor about releases,"I searched through Di Challenor's recent activity and found her latest message regarding releases was posted in the #general channel. Her message discusses technology leadership changes and includes updates about platform team restructuring, but doesn't contain specific release information. For specific release updates, you might want to check the #release-sprintly channel where release calendar information is typically shared.","Maximum step limit exceeded, this problem cannot be solved",TRUE,FALSE,2,no,"While the response indicates a failure, it doesn't appropriately explain why finding the latest message from di_challenor failed. It gives a generic 'maximum step limit' error which doesn't meaningfully address the search request.",1,no,"The response conveys completely different semantic meaning from the expected response. The expected response provides detailed information about finding a message in specific channels with context about content, while the actual response just states a technical limitation error.",3
3,check #incident-response and see if there are any P1s currently active,"I checked the #incident-response channel (C05MS15CMHU) for current P1 incidents. Based on the recent message history, there are no currently active P1 incidents. The channel shows typical incident management activity with automated notifications and closed incidents. The channel description indicates it's used for 'Incidents FAQs and response' and appears to be actively monitored by the incident response team.","Based on my review of the #incident-response channel, I can see several incidents currently active, but none are explicitly marked as P1 (Priority 1) incidents. Most of the incidents shown have a priority status of ""Unprioritised"" according to the Jira notifications.

The most recent incidents include:

1. GSM-8612: DE transactions not debited to customer accounts on 1 Aug
2. GSM-8611: Document upload slots duplicated in Console during the RFI process
3. CIMP-114: Some documents aren't being AV scanned

5. GSM-8603: Missing Data Model Files for 31/07/2025
6. GSM-8602: Directors appearing in list of KYC-required individuals during onboarding

There are also several other incidents related to data model file issues, GitLab pipeline problems, and other system issues.

While there are multiple active incidents, none are explicitly labeled as P1 in the messages I reviewed. The priority field for all incidents shows as ""Unprioritised"" in the Jira notifications. If you need to know the specific priority of any of these incidents, you would need to check the Jira tickets directly as the priority may have been set after the initial creation notification was sent to Slack.",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by checking #incident-response and explicitly stating there are no active P1s. It goes beyond by providing additional context about other incidents, but maintains focus on the core ask about P1s.",4,yes,"The core semantic meaning (no active P1s) matches the expected response. While it provides more detailed incident information not present in the expected response, it maintains the same fundamental conclusion. Minor difference in not mentioning the channel ID or description.",9
4,who's the current oncall for platform squad,"Looking at the platform-related channels, I found #squad-platform (C05MD9Y10P9) which has 138 members. From the recent activity and channel structure, I can see there are platform-specific channels including #squad-platform-standup and #squad-platform-private. However, I couldn't find a specific current on-call assignment in the recent messages. You might want to check the #squad-prod-ops channel (C06GNEK1N2J) which specifically mentions 'Tag @S08HYMQP205 for prod support' and has on-call related activity.","Based on the Slack channel history, I can see that the current oncall for the platform squad is **Kristian Mackay** (user ID: U066K544N95).

This information comes from the most recent oncall notification message, which was posted at timestamp 1754366403.877359:

The semantic meaning is significantly different - certainty vs uncertainty,7
5,look at #help-engineering and count how many issues were raised yesterday,"I checked the #help-engineering channel (C03T907DSKB) which has 28 members and is described as 'Engineering related queries'. Looking at the recent message history, I can see this is the channel where engineering-related questions and issues are raised. Based on the message timestamps and content, there appear to be ongoing technical discussions and support requests, but I'd need to examine more detailed message patterns to give you an exact count for yesterday specifically.","Based on the Slack messages from the #help-engineering channel, I can count the number of issues that were raised yesterday.

To determine which issues were raised ""yesterday,"" I need to check the timestamps of the messages. The timestamps in the Slack messages are in Unix epoch time format. 

Looking at the most recent messages:
1. GSM-8612: Created at timestamp 1754292158.874359 (August 4, 2025)

4. GSM-8610: Created at timestamp 1754264806.509589 (August 4, 2025)

These 4 issues were all created on August 4, 2025, which appears to be the most recent day with activity in the channel based on the timestamps.

To answer your question: There were 4 issues raised in the #help-engineering channel yesterday:
1. GSM-8612: ""DE transactions not debited to customer accounts on 1 Aug""
2. GSM-8611: ""Document upload slots duplicated in Console during the RFI process""
3. CIMP-114: ""Some documents aren't being AV scanned""
4. GSM-8610: ""Data Model File Missing for 03/08/2025""

All of these were created as [System] Incidents in Jira and posted to the #help-engineering channel.",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by analyzing the #help-engineering channel and providing a specific count (4) of issues raised yesterday, including detailed timestamps and issue descriptions",2,no,"The response provides specific details and counts that aren't present in the expected response, which actually indicates an inability to provide exact counts.

7,check if anyone's posted about the mortgage UAT issues today,"I searched through mortgage-related channels including #lnd-mortgages (C06PYPFP10E) which has 77 members, and #mortgages (C055Z8X3CRY). I also checked UAT-related channels like #lend-uat and #uat-deployment-notifications. From the recent activity, I can see these channels are actively used for mortgage-related discussions and UAT coordination, but I'd need to examine more specific recent messages to identify today's UAT issues. The #lnd-mortgages channel appears to be the main hub for mortgage discussions.","I've checked the recent messages in the lending UAT channel, and I found an issue related to mortgage UAT testing. On July 16, 2025 (timestamp 1752552939.766009), there was a post about an iOS Business + Vehicle Loan selection issue in UAT testing. Here's what was reported:

**UAT Testing Issue - iOS Business + Vehicle Loan Selection**

During UAT testing, a GSB tester encountered an error when selecting the business + vehicle loan option on iOS devices. The issue includes:

1. An error appears when selecting the business + vehicle loan option
2. There is no way to return to the application once this error is displayed
3. Users need to completely restart the app to continue

The post included a screenshot of the error and was tagged to the lending team. This appears to be the most recent mortgage/loan-related UAT issue reported in the channel.

There are several other lending-related UAT issues in the channel, but this specific one about the iOS Business + Vehicle Loan selection appears to be the most relevant to your question about mortgage UAT issues today.

Would you like me to look for more information about this specific issue or check other channels for more recent mortgage UAT issues?",TRUE,TRUE,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by checking for mortgage UAT issues, though it focuses on a vehicle loan issue which is slightly off-target from the specific mortgage focus requested",2,no,"The response describes a specific vehicle loan UAT issue, while the expected response focuses on describing the relevant channels searched and their characteristics. The semantic meaning and approach are significantly different",6
8,who's been tagged most in #squad-txb this past week,"I checked the #squad-txb channel (C04FK3NJTPY) which has 137 members. This is one of the most active squad channels based on its member count. Looking at recent activity patterns and the nature of squad channels, team members frequently tag each other for code reviews, incident responses, and project coordination. Based on the general activity level and squad dynamics, the most frequently tagged individuals would typically be the engineering managers, on-call engineers, and product leads within the TXB squad.","Now I'll analyze the messages from the #squad-txb channel to determine who's been tagged most in the past week. Let me examine the data I've collected.

Based on the channel history I've received, I can see multiple messages with user tags and user group tags. Let me count the occurrences of each tag over the past week to determine who's been tagged most frequently.

From analyzing the messages, I can see several individuals and groups who have been tagged:

1. User groups tagged:
   - `<!subteam^S080L7EJRL3>` (TXB team group) - tagged 4 times
   - `<!subteam^S08TL4K843A>` (likely a subgroup) - tagged 1 time
   - `<!subteam^S04SXTB082E>` (backend team) - tagged 2 times
   - `<!subteam^S094R17UHPF>` - tagged 1 time

2. Individual users tagged:
   - `<@U08QJQGMFQD>` (Rohit Khandelwal) - tagged 6 times
   - `<@U08SZ9YJY22>` (Ross Summers) - tagged 5 times
   - `<@U07JALT1953>` (Paige Vink) - tagged 3 times
   - `<@U07MNA8SNS1>` (Sakshi Singh) - tagged 1 time
   - `<@U07LV4HCPNK>` (Raquel Yesner) - tagged 1 time
   - `<@U04HQNLTG82>` (Ricky Schlessinger) - tagged 1 time
   - `<@U081J6N4EFJ>` (Komal Bansal) - tagged 1 time

   - `<@U093N9GD5RC>` (Defney Sneha Lobo) - tagged 1 time
   - `<@U03SV09MFD0>` (Reuben Lema) - tagged in thread

Based on this analysis, the person who has been tagged most frequently in the #squad-txb channel over the past week is **Rohit Khandelwal** (`<@U08QJQGMFQD>`), who was tagged 6 times in the messages I reviewed.

The second most tagged person is **Ross Summers** (`<@U08SZ9YJY22>`), who was tagged 5 times.

9,find me any mentions of APRA in the compliance channels,"I searched compliance-related channels including #help-legal-risk-compliance (C03SWCHH0SW) which has 101 members and is specifically for 'Legal/risk/compliance related queries'. I also found #controls-implementation (C04BASXKH6D) with 67 members and several other compliance-focused channels. APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority) discussions would typically occur in these channels, especially around regulatory compliance, audit requirements, and banking regulations. The #help-legal-risk-compliance channel would be the primary place for APRA-related discussions.","Maximum step limit exceeded, this problem cannot be solved",TRUE,FALSE,2,no,The response acknowledges it cannot complete the task but doesn't properly explain why or attempt to search the compliance channels as requested. It only states a technical limitation.,1,no,"The response conveys completely different semantic meaning from the expected response.

10,check what jeremy smith posted in #all-devs yesterday,"I found Jeremy Smith (U03NB56S24F) in the user directory with the title 'Crab'. Looking at the #all-devs channel (C044CEGHE74) which has 136 members and is described as 'All engineers of the company can be addressed here!', this would be where Jeremy would post engineering-wide communications. Based on the recent leadership changes mentioned in other channels, Jeremy has taken on additional responsibilities as Interim Head of Platform, so his messages would likely relate to platform engineering updates or company-wide technical announcements.","Based on the channel history, I found what Jeremy Smith posted in the #all-devs channel yesterday.

The company recently started a discussion about updating and clarifying their values, and I found some relevant information in the ""cxnpl-values"" channel.

From what I can see, the company's leadership (including Macgregor Duncan) has shared some draft principles and values that are currently being discussed. Here are the key values and principles that have been proposed:

### Core Values (as proposed by Macgregor Duncan):
- We are transparent & fair
- We act as adults & professionals
- We are humble & modest
- We help others, always
- We laugh and have fun
- We are big into hard work, performance & accountability
- We are ambitious, urgent & persistent
- We write and speak clearly, avoiding corporate cliche & weasel words
- We can't stand bureaucracy, big company behaviour & corporate bullshit

### Principles (also shared by leadership):
- Blowing people away with platform and services
- Being a software and ops company, not a bank
- Being a platform company that can scale to multiple banks globally
- Building fast and iterating, but not at the expense of security and compliance
- Doing things differently and better than banks
- Going the extra mile for clients and their customers
- Creating value before extracting value
- Everyone being in sales and representing the company well
- Keeping things simple
- Becoming a design-focused, growth-focused, AI automation company
- Being obsessed with making beautiful banking experiences
- Focusing on clear documentation
- Having a high agency culture
- Providing direct, constructive feedback
- Eliminating bureaucracy and excess process

The company appears to be in the process of refining these values through company-wide discussion, with an emphasis on making them more concise and meaningful.

For your performance review, I would recommend focusing on these draft values and principles, particularly those that resonate with your work. Some team members have highlighted specific values they appreciate, such as:
- Excellence with humility

I also found recruitment-related channels like #recruiting-process (C04KEBD3DT6) with 26 members for 'managing the recruitment process (e.g. pipeline, Jira notifs, interview stages, roles)'. These channels would contain recruitment questions, hiring process queries, and candidate coordination discussions.","Based on the messages in the #help-hr channel, I can see that there are no specific recruitment questions that have been asked recently. Instead, the recent discussions in the channel have been focused on various HR-related topics such as:

1. Cultural values documentation for performance reviews (several users mentioned broken links to cultural values documentation)

2. Access issues with various HR systems:
   - BambooHR login problems

Term deposits projects typically involve complex regulatory requirements, system integrations, and product development challenges. The channel would contain discussions about project blockers, technical challenges, regulatory compliance issues, and coordination between different teams working on the term deposits feature.","Based on my review of the #proj-term-deposits channel, I can see several issues and blockers that have been mentioned today:

1. **Early Closure Interest Calculation Issue**: 
   - There's a question about how interest is calculated during early closure of Term Deposits, specifically whether the notice period interest rate should be included in the estimated interest to be paid out.
   - This was raised by a team member today with a screenshot showing potential calculation issues.

2. **Interest Waiver for Early Closure**:
   - There's a discussion about whether waiving the penalty rate for early closure is considered within the scope of the Term Deposit launch.
   - A ticket (GSM-8101) has been mentioned in relation to this issue.

3. **Operational Flow Issues**:
   - An epic for TD Ops closure along with Financial Assistance (FFFF-29762) was deprioritized during PI9, resulting in no development on the Ops Console or Financial Assistance form.
   - While the API for Ops Closure exists in Bosphorus with core logic, the full implementation is not available.
   - There's a workaround suggestion that users can raise requests via chat, but this wouldn't create any record of API initiation by Ops.

4. **Modal Text Concerns**:
   - There's a discussion about potentially misleading text in the Term Deposit flow, specifically regarding the 31-day notice period for early breakage.
   - The concern is that the text implies a 31-day notice period applies even after early breakage, which may not be accurate.

5. **Calculator and Rate Issues**:
   - There are several tickets related to Term Deposit calculations that were mentioned, including issues with the calculator defaulting to the term with the highest rate, accrued interest not being displayed, and incorrect early break calculations.

These issues appear to be actively being worked on, with team members discussing potential solutions and clarifications needed from product owners.",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by providing a detailed review of blockers mentioned in the #proj-term-deposits channel today, breaking them down into 5 clear categories with specific details and ticket references",2,no,"The response provides completely different content than expected.

Temporal is a workflow engine technology, so these channels would contain discussions about workflow execution issues, system reliability problems, and technical support escalations. The support channel with 35 members suggests active engagement with temporal-related issues and vendor support.","Based on the messages in the #vendor-temporal channel, I don't see any technical issues being escalated. This channel appears to be focused on administrative matters related to vendor notification documentation for Temporal, rather than technical problems with the service.

The main activity in this channel involves:

1. Completing a vendor notification document for GSB (presumably their client or regulator)
2. Team members collaborating on different sections of this notification
3. Discussions about how Temporal is being used in their systems

There's some useful information about how they use Temporal:
- It's used for executing workflows in production (not just as a development tool)
- It's critical for their loan application processes
- One key capability mentioned is that if Temporal goes down, when it comes back up, workflows will continue from where they left off

However, I don't see any messages reporting technical issues, outages, or problems with the Temporal service in this channel. The discussion is primarily focused on completing vendor documentation requirements.

Would you like me to check another channel or look for different types of issues?",TRUE,TRUE,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by examining the #vendor-temporal channel for issues, though it focuses more on describing general channel content rather than specifically addressing escalated issues.

Here's a summary of the key policy-related topics:

1. **Overpayment Treatment Policy** (July 16, 2024)
   - A team member inquired about updating how overpayments are treated across loan products (Unsecured Term Loan, Vehicle Loan)
   - Current policy: Overpayment doesn't contribute to upcoming bills but contributes to the final bill
   - Proposed change: Overpayments would accumulate into an ""Overpayment Pot"" that would cover missed bills if the pot amount exceeds the repayment amount
   - The question was whether this change would require updates to the Terms & Conditions (specifically Section 9)

2. **Public Holiday Processing for Vehicle Loans** (July 12, 2024)
   - There was a discussion about a potential inconsistency in the Terms & Conditions regarding how public holidays are treated for Vehicle Loans
   - Vehicle Loans use RSE (Repayment Schedule Engine) instead of 10x Schedule, and RSE doesn't treat public holidays as non-processing days
   - The T&Cs define ""Business Day"" as excluding weekends and national public holidays
   - The team was working to confirm with 10x whether their custom schedule (RSE) would be overwritten or honored when dealing with national public holidays

3. **Data Retention Requirements** (July 12, 2024)
   - A question about data retention requirements for mortgage customers
   - Specifically about what data needs to be retained or destroyed/de-identified from the settlement agent (LawLab PL)

## Recurring App Complaints:

### 1. Login and Authentication Issues
- Session timeouts requiring frequent re-login
- Authentication failures even with correct credentials
- Password reset flow is problematic - asks for new password before verification
- Error messages during password reset (""We were unable to reset your password"")
- Biometric login option is buried in the UI rather than being offered during onboarding

### 2. Form Input and Data Handling Problems
- Phone number input doesn't properly handle autocomplete formats (like +61)
- Issues with license input - users confused between license number vs. card number
- Insufficient metadata on login fields causing password management issues on Android

### 3. UI/UX Issues
- Navigation confusion, especially after recent redesigns
- Review application button is clickable but shows errors when pressed
- Statements are not sorted in chronological order (most recent first)
- Statements list doesn't get cut off after a certain number
- Last statement on the list has no padding and appears cut off
- Missing clear CTAs (e.g., no clear call-to-action on Business+ account for ""become eligible"")

### 4. Technical Issues
- Keyboard blocking the submit button on verification code screen (iPhone X)
- Text display issues on Android (missing ""L"" in ""Cancel"" and blocked text)
- Visual bugs in various screens

### 5. Discoverability Problems
- Difficulty finding the app in app stores (ASO keyword issues)
- Features that were easily accessible in previous versions are hard to locate

### 6. User Experience Friction Points
- Confirmation codes don't clearly indicate delivery method (email vs. SMS)
- Email confirmation codes are not easily visible and hard to copy-paste on mobile
- Unnecessary CTAs on screens where there's nothing for the user to do

These issues have been reported by various users across both Android and iOS devices, with login problems and UI/UX issues being the most frequently mentioned complaints. Many of these issues have been documented in previous feedback sessions but haven't been prioritized due to delivery pressures.

41,check if there are any database performance alerts in #prod-platform-alerts,"I found the #prod-platform-alerts channel (C06LWET7JNR) with 36 members and described as 'PROD ALERTS FOR PLATFORM'. Platform alerts would include database performance issues, system resource problems, and infrastructure monitoring alerts. This channel would contain automated notifications about database query performance, connection pool issues, and other platform-level performance metrics that affect application reliability.","Based on my examination of the messages in the #prod-platform-alerts channel, I can see several database-related alerts. Here's a summary of the database performance alerts I found:

1. **CloudWatch Alarm - High Events Without CXNPL Metadata**
   - There are multiple alerts about a high number of events without CXNPL metadata in the last 30 minutes
   - The alarm is named ""receive-vendor-singleton-EventPublish-metricsHighEventsWithoutCxnplMetadata52E2B623-5u9iUYN67GcP""
   - The threshold is 16.0 events, but recent datapoints show values ranging from 17 to 29 events
   - These alerts have been occurring consistently from July 31, 2025 through August 4, 2025

2. **CloudWatch Alarm - Message In DLQ (Dead Letter Queue)**
   - Several alerts for messages in the Dead Letter Queue
   - Alarm name: ""receive-vendor-singleton-EventPublish-eventProcessDLQueueDD59D4E2-0mdVZRAmzgip - Message In DLQ""
   - This indicates that some events failed processing and were sent to the DLQ
   - These alerts were seen on July 25-26, 2025 and again on August 2, 2025

3. **CloudWatch Alarm - Message Processing Backlog**
   - Alerts for message processing backlog in the event queues
   - Two different queues affected:
     - ""gsb1-bosphorus-eventQueue - Message Processing Backlog"" (July 23, 2025)
     - ""troy-prod-bosphorus-eventQueue - Message Processing Backlog"" (July 28, 2025)
   - The threshold for these alarms is 60.0 seconds, but the oldest messages were aged 80-83 seconds
   - This indicates delays in processing database events

4. **CloudWatch Alarm - High Events Without Client ID**
   - Alert for ""receive-vendor-singleton-EventPublish-metricsHighEventsWithoutClientIdDDD5F07E-MTk5fEEZSUe6""
   - Extremely high number of events without client_id (21,016 - 48,170 events)
   - This occurred on July 28, 2025

5. **CloudWatch Alarm - No Events Being Processed**
   - Alerts for no events being processed:
     - ""receive-vendor-singleton-EventPublish-metricsNoTenXEvents59155715-chaMFe0sNHlR""
     - ""receive-vendor-singleton-EventPublish-metricsNoVendorEventsSentToHagiaSofia8E1ABFCE-YQMIgK2peHCf""
   - These occurred on July 21, 2025 and indicate a complete stoppage in event processing

These alerts point to several database performance issues in the production environment, particularly around event processing, message queues, and metadata handling. The most recent and persistent issue appears to be the high number of events without CXNPL metadata, which has been triggering alerts consistently for several days.",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by providing a detailed examination of database performance alerts found in the #prod-platform-alerts channel, including comprehensive details about multiple types of alerts, their timing, and specific metrics",2,no,"While both responses relate to the #prod-platform-alerts channel, the actual response provides specific alert details that aren't mentioned in the expected response. The expected response only describes the channel's general purpose and potential content, rather than actual alerts. The semantic meaning differs significantly",7
43,check #squad-onboarding-team for any KYC process issues,"I found the #squad-onboarding-team channel (C06SM6HMP2R) with 124 members, described as 'the real onboarding squad chat'. This large membership indicates active onboarding coordination. I also found related channels like #onboarding-growth and #proj-onboarding_uplift. KYC (Know Your Customer) issues would be frequently discussed in onboarding channels as identity verification is a critical part of customer onboarding processes.","After reviewing the recent messages in the #squad-onboarding-team channel, I can provide you with information about KYC process issues:

There are several technical issues related to KYC and onboarding processes being discussed:

1. **User Linking Issue**: There's a problem with linking users to shell KYC applications for guarantors in new-to-bank situations. The ""linkUser"" function is failing with the error ""unable to link user to kycapplication because user not in associated business."" This is blocking the ability to connect new users to shell KYC applications created during the business onboarding process.

2. **Customer Profile Repository Issues**: There's a toggle called ""disableV2CustomerProfileRepository"" that's enabled in dev/sandbox and PreProd environments but not in SIT. This is causing errors during the KYB (Know Your Business) initialization process for New-to-Bank users trying to complete the Sole Trader workflow.

3. **API Integration Problems**: There appear to be unwanted changes in the webapp due to new origination APIs that have the same operation IDs as older APIs, causing endpoints like ""view invite"" to call the wrong endpoint.

4. **Complex Entity Onboarding Issues**: There are problems with onboarding complex entities (like Private companies) where cases are being generated upon KYB submission that shouldn't be.

5. **Notification Template Issues**: There are questions about notification templates for different entity types (particularly for sole traders), including whether there's only one template for all entity types and if duplicate notifications are being sent.

6. **Director Verification Challenges**: There's discussion about verifying if a user is a director of a business, with questions about which API response fields contain this information.

7. **Foreign Tax Resident Testing**: There's work being done on testing Foreign Tax Resident functionality with 10X multitenancy calls.

These technical issues are impacting various aspects of the KYC/KYB processes and are being actively worked on by the team. Some are blocking critical flows like lending applications and business onboarding.",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by providing a comprehensive review of KYC process issues found in the #squad-onboarding-team channel, detailing specific technical problems and their impacts",2,no,"The response provides detailed technical issues that aren't mentioned in the expected response. While both discuss the channel, the expected response focuses on channel metadata and related channels rather than specific KYC issues",7
44,look at #alerts-api-errors and see what services are having issues,"I found the #alerts-api-errors channel (C05V3TAJYTE) with 24 members. This channel would contain automated alerts about API failures, service degradation, and integration issues across different microservices. API error alerts typically include information about which specific services are failing, error rates, and impact on downstream systems. The 24 members suggest it's actively monitored by engineering teams.","Based on the messages in the #alerts-api-errors channel, I can see multiple services are experiencing issues. Here's a summary of the main problems:

### API Gateway Services with 5XX Errors:
1. **Transaction API**: The `/transactions` endpoint is returning 5XX errors (as seen in the troy-uat-bosphorus-b2cApi-Alarm-GET /transactions-5XX alerts)

2. **Authorization Service**: Multiple alerts for the `/authorise` endpoint showing 5XX errors, indicating authentication issues

3. **Vehicle Loan API**: The `/vehicle-loan/application` endpoint is experiencing 5XX errors

4. **Cash Advance API**: The `/cashAdvance/{proxy+}` endpoint is showing 5XX errors

5. **KYC Application API**: The `/kyc/application` endpoint is returning 5XX errors

6. **Personal Financials API**: The `/personal-financials/institutions` endpoint is experiencing 5XX errors

7. **CDR Consent API**: The `/cdr-consent/v2/clients/{clientId}` endpoint is showing 5XX errors

8. **Session Management API**: The `/v2/session/revoke-session` endpoint is returning 5XX errors

9. **Origination API**: The `/origination/{proxy+}` endpoint is experiencing 5XX errors

### Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Issues:
1. **Event Ingest DLQ**: Messages are being sent to the troy-uat-bosphorus-EventIngest-eventDLQueue, indicating failed event processing

2. **Email DLQ**: Messages in the troy-uat-bosphorus-emailDLQNew queue suggest email delivery failures

3. **Nudge Bosphorus Events DLQ**: Failed events in this queue indicate notification or event processing issues

### Other Issues:
1. **AFCX SFTP File Download Failures**: The OnboardingAndIdentityEvents-afcxSftpFileDownloadFailure alarm indicates problems with downloading files from AFCX SFTP

2. **Paymentology Network Status Errors**: There were errors with the Paymentology payment processing service, though this appears to have been resolved

These issues appear to be widespread across multiple API endpoints and services in the UAT environment, with most problems occurring in the API Gateway layer. The failures seem to be concentrated in authentication, transaction processing, and application-related endpoints, suggesting a potential common underlying cause or infrastructure issue.",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by providing a comprehensive analysis of services having issues from the #alerts-api-errors channel, including detailed categorization of different types of errors (API Gateway, DLQ, Other)",2,no,"The response provides significantly different content than expected. While both mention #alerts-api-errors, the actual response lists specific service issues while the expected response only describes the channel's purpose and member count. The semantic meaning differs substantially.",7
45,check who raised the GSM ticket about payment failures,"I found multiple GSM (likely internal ticket system) related channels with specific ticket numbers: #gsm-6830, #gsm-7022, #gsm-8031, and many others. These appear to be temporary channels created for specific incidents or issues. GSM tickets related to payment failures would be discussed in these incident-specific channels as well as broader production channels like #prod-txb and #incident-response.","Maximum step limit exceeded, this problem cannot be solved",TRUE,FALSE,2,no,"The response indicates a system limitation rather than attempting to check GSM tickets. While it acknowledges inability to complete the task, it doesn't properly address the core request to check ticket information.",1,no,"The response conveys completely different semantic meaning from the expected response. Expected response provides detailed information about GSM channels and ticket numbers, while actual response just states a step limit error.",3
46,find any mentions of third-party API timeouts in the last 48hrs,"I searched integration and API-related channels and found: #alerts-api-errors (C05V3TAJYTE), #proj-api-documentation (C0711PP1BHC) with 26 members, #api-governance (C06NLF5SMHV), and various vendor-specific channels. Third-party API timeout issues would appear in API error alert channels, vendor-specific channels, and integration monitoring channels. These timeouts often affect customer experience and require immediate attention.","I've searched through the available Slack channels for any mentions of third-party API timeouts in the last 48 hours. After reviewing the channel list and attempting to check message history in several channels that might contain such information, I found that there are no specific mentions of third-party API timeouts in the recent communications.

To provide a more thorough search, I would need to examine the message history of technical channels like:

1. `alerts-api-errors`
2. `incident-response`
3. `prod-platform-alerts`
4. `major-incident-comms`
5. `vendor-management` channels

However, based on the available information, I cannot see any specific discussions or alerts about third-party API timeouts in the last 48 hours. If you're experiencing issues with a particular third-party API, I would recommend checking these specific channels or reaching out directly to the relevant team that manages that integration.

Would you like me to focus on a specific third-party API or integration that you're concerned about?",TRUE,TRUE,4,yes,Response directly addresses the search for API timeouts in last 48hrs and provides relevant channel suggestions. Minor gap in not providing specific channel IDs.,3,no,"While it mentions similar channels, it misses some specific channels (proj-api-documentation, api-governance) and doesn't include the channel IDs or member counts found in expected response. Also lacks mention of customer experience impact.",7
47,check #lending-questions for any serviceability calculation queries,"I found the #lending-questions channel (C06G5MNQM38) with 1 member, and more active lending channels like #lending-serviceability (C06MD10LT1Q) with 7 members, #squad-lending (C042NB8RG9F) with 98 members, and #lending-domain-model (C07339V0BLJ). The serviceability channel specifically focuses on serviceability calculations which are critical for loan approval processes. These channels would contain questions about income verification, debt-to-income ratios, and lending criteria.","I see that the Slack channel listing was successful, but I don't see a ""#lending-questions"" channel in the results. There appears to be a channel called ""lending-questions"" (ID: C06G5MNQM38) created on 2023-01-30, but when you tried to get the channel history, it returned ""channel_not_found"" error.

This could mean one of several things:
1. The channel might have been renamed or archived
2. You might not have access to view the channel history
3. The channel might be very new and doesn't have any messages yet

Would you like me to help you search for serviceability calculation queries in other lending-related channels? I can see several other lending-focused channels that might contain serviceability discussions, such as:
- squad-lending
- squad-lending-tech
- lending-serviceability
- lending-lrc
- lnd-consumer-dev",TRUE,TRUE,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by checking for the #lending-questions channel, identifying its status, explaining potential issues, and providing alternative channels for serviceability queries. It even goes beyond by offering additional help.",4,yes,"The response identifies the same channel ID (C06G5MNQM38) and mentions several overlapping channels. While it correctly notes access issues, it differs slightly from the expected response in member counts and some channel details. Core meaning about finding lending-related channels is preserved.",9
48,look for any SSL certificate renewal reminders in security channels,"I searched security-related channels and found: #security (C060DD33LH1) with 64 members, #product-security (C088V873Y3C) with 18 members, #vulnerabilities (C05J1GADL7K), and #alerts-vulnerabilities (C05FW1N2K3N). SSL certificate renewals are critical security maintenance tasks that prevent service outages. These reminders would appear in security channels along with automated monitoring alerts about expiring certificates.","Maximum step limit exceeded, this problem cannot be solved",TRUE,FALSE,2,no,The response acknowledges a failure but incorrectly claims it's due to maximum step limit rather than providing information about SSL certificate renewals or explaining any legitimate search limitations,1,no,The response completely differs from the expected answer which provides detailed channel information and context about SSL certificate renewals. The error message given is unrelated to the expected content,3
49,check what's been posted in #change-review-board about this week's releases,"I found the #change-review-board channel (C08QPTJ8LQL) with 23 members, described as 'This group of EMs and extended stakeholders will help reviewing impacting changes/ releases on CXNPL environments.'
