0,can you check who's been most active in #fraud-fincrime-ops this week,"I checked the #fraud-fincrime-ops channel (C05HPT6MWAE) and found recent activity from several team members. Looking at the message history, the most active participants this week include Lily Doyle, Campbell Wang, and Chloe Lee, who have been actively discussing customer cases, identity fraud investigations, and account offboarding procedures. The conversations show typical fraud team activities like reviewing suspicious transactions, handling MCL cases, and coordinating with GSB on customer communications.","I can see that the channel history you provided is from the **#proj-releaseplan** channel, not a fraud or financial crime operations channel. This appears to be a project management channel focused on release planning for CXNPL (Constantinople), with discussions about compliance plans, testing, and project coordination.

Looking at the activity in this channel, the most active users appear to be:

1. **U03PGMWH1C1** - Most active with multiple substantive messages about:
   - Testing and configuration planning
   - TPSA and GSB Schedules
   - Compliance plan discussions
   - Business team coordination

2. **U03NRFRGQGK** - Very active, appears to be a project lead:
   - Created the project board
   - Provided instructions to team members
   - Set up the channel and invited participants

However, this doesn't seem to be the fraud/financial crime operations channel you were asking about. 

**To help you find activity in the correct channel, could you please:**

1. **Verify the exact channel name** - Is it possibly:
   - #fraud-fincrime-ops (with hyphens)
   - #fraud_fincrime_ops (with underscores)
   - #fraud-and-fincrime-ops
   - Or a different variation?

2. **Check if it might be a private channel** that's not showing in the public channel list

3. **Or let me know if you'd like me to check the #financialcrime or #fraud-manual channels instead**, which are the closest matches I found in your workspace

Would you like me to get the user profiles for the active users in this release planning channel, or would you prefer to clarify which channel you're actually interested in?",True,True,4,yes,"The response addresses the core request to check activity in a channel, but goes beyond by correctly identifying that the wrong channel was provided. It offers constructive alternatives and seeks clarification, showing good prompt handling.",2,no,"The response describes activity in a completely different channel (#proj-releaseplan) and different users than the expected response, which details specific fraud team activities and named individuals in #fraud-fincrime-ops. The core content and context are significantly different.",6
1,find me the latest message from di_challenor about releases,"I searched through Di Challenor's recent activity and found her latest message regarding releases was posted in the #general channel. Her message discusses technology leadership changes and includes updates about platform team restructuring, but doesn't contain specific release information. For specific release updates, you might want to check the #release-sprintly channel where release calendar information is typically shared.","I can see from the messages in the general channel that this is a very active Slack workspace, but I don't see any messages specifically from a user named ""di_challenor"" about releases in the recent messages shown.

The messages I can see are primarily from the general channel and include:
- Security PSAs
- Incident management updates
- Anniversary congratulations
- Birthday wishes
- Mobile app launch announcements (GSB Business+ and Mob 2.0)
- HR and salary packaging information

However, none of these messages appear to be from ""di_challenor"" specifically about releases. It's possible that:

1. The user ""di_challenor"" might not be active in the general channel
2. Their release-related messages might be in other channels that weren't searched
3. The messages might be older than what's currently visible in the channel history
4. The username might be slightly different

Could you help me by:
- Confirming the exact username or display name for this person
- Suggesting specific channels where they might post about releases (like engineering, development, or release-specific channels)
- Providing any additional context about what kind of releases they typically discuss

This would help me search more effectively for their latest messages about releases.",True,True,4,yes,"The response addresses the prompt by attempting to find messages from di_challenor about releases and acknowledges inability to find specific release messages. It provides a thorough explanation of what was found instead and suggests next steps, though it takes a slightly more uncertain approach than the expected response.",3,no,"While both responses indicate an absence of specific release information, the actual response misses key details present in the expected response - namely that Di Challenor did have a recent message about technology leadership changes, and the specific mention of the #release-sprintly channel for release updates. The response is more general and speculative.",7
2,check #incident-response and see if there are any P1s currently active,"I checked the #incident-response channel (C05MS15CMHU) for current P1 incidents. Based on the recent message history, there are no currently active P1 incidents. The channel shows typical incident management activity with automated notifications and closed incidents. The channel description indicates it's used for 'Incidents FAQs and response' and appears to be actively monitored by the incident response team.","Based on my review of the recent messages in the #incident-response channel, I can see there are **multiple active incidents**, but **none appear to be P1 incidents**. Here's what I found:

## **Current Active Incidents (All appear to be P2 or lower priority):**

**Recent Active System Incidents:**
- **GSM-8637** - Transaction experiencing a processing delay (Status: In-Progress, Priority: Unprioritised)
- **GSM-8636** - Collection Notice issued without GSB approval (Status: In-Progress, Priority: Unprioritised)
- **GSM-8634** - Mobile App root detection reporting false positives (Status: Open, Priority: Unprioritised)
- **GSM-8631** - Bankers Console - Unable to access (Status: Open, Priority: Unprioritised)
- **CIMP-116** - Card auth clearing & chargeback process regression (Status: Open, Priority: Unprioritised)
- **GSM-8619** - Banker's console 'My tasks' page error condition (Status: Open, Priority: Unprioritised)

**Key Observations:**
- All recent incidents show ""Priority: Unprioritised"" or ""Priority: Moderate"" at most
- No incidents are explicitly marked as P1 (Critical/Highest priority)
- Most incidents are in ""Open"" or ""In-Progress"" status, indicating they are being worked on
- The incidents cover various systems including transaction processing, mobile app, bankers console, and card processing

**Conclusion:** There are **no currently active P1 incidents** in the #incident-response channel. The active incidents appear to be lower priority system issues that are being tracked and addressed through normal incident management processes.",True,True,5,yes,The response directly addresses the prompt by checking #incident-response and explicitly stating there are no active P1s. It goes above and beyond by providing detailed context about other active incidents.,4,yes,"The core semantic meaning (no active P1s) matches perfectly. The response provides additional detail about other incidents not mentioned in the expected response, but doesn't mention the channel ID or description that the expected response includes.",9
3,look at #help-engineering and count how many issues were raised yesterday,"I checked the #help-engineering channel (C03T907DSKB) which has 28 members and is described as 'Engineering related queries'. Looking at the recent message history, I can see this is the channel where engineering-related questions and issues are raised. Based on the message timestamps and content, there appear to be ongoing technical discussions and support requests, but I'd need to examine more detailed message patterns to give you an exact count for yesterday specifically.","Based on my analysis of the #help-engineering channel messages, I need to look at the timestamps to identify messages from yesterday. The timestamps are in Unix format, so I need to convert them to determine which messages were from yesterday (December 21, 2024, since today appears to be December 22, 2024 based on the most recent timestamps).

Looking at the messages, I can see various timestamps ranging from recent dates. Let me analyze the messages that would be from ""yesterday"":

After reviewing all the messages in the #help-engineering channel, I can see that this channel appears to be primarily used for HR and administrative queries rather than technical engineering issues. The messages I found include:

- Questions about cultural values links for performance reviews
- Employment Hero correspondence queries  
- WebExpenses login issues
- BambooHR access problems
- Payroll and HR-related questions
- Office supply and facility issues

**Count of issues raised yesterday: 0**

The messages I can see in the channel don't show any engineering-related technical issues that were raised yesterday. The channel appears to be misnamed or repurposed, as it's being used for HR/administrative support rather than engineering technical support. The most recent messages are about cultural values links and similar HR matters, not engineering issues.

If you're looking for actual engineering issues, you might want to check other channels like #eng-backend, #all-devs, or other technical channels that might be more appropriate for engineering problem reports.",True,True,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by attempting to count issues from yesterday, acknowledging the need to check timestamps, and providing a clear count (0) with explanation of what was found instead",2,no,"The response contradicts the expected answer by describing the channel as HR/administrative focused rather than engineering-focused, and provides different channel membership context. Core understanding of channel purpose differs significantly",7
4,can you find ned's message about the AI procurement thing from last month,"I searched for Ned Loneragan (U0483VAPB3Q) in the user list - his title shows as 'Cxnpl'. Looking through recent channel activity, I found several channels where procurement and AI-related discussions typically happen, including #ai-cxnpl, #vendor-management, and #help-third-party-vendors. However, I didn't find the specific AI procurement message from last month in the immediate message history. You might want to search in #vendor-management (C05M44V0N4D) or #ai-cxnpl (C08ATQF7XFF) channels where such discussions are more likely to occur.","I searched through the finance channel messages and found some discussions about various finance-related topics, but I didn't find any specific messages from Ned Loneragan (U0483VAPB3Q) about AI procurement from last month.

Looking through the available message history, I can see discussions about:
- Accounting manuals and processes
- Settlement reconciliations
- Suspense accounts
- Various finance-related tickets and issues
- TYRO and other client-related finance matters

However, I don't see any messages specifically about AI procurement from Ned. This could be because:

1. The message might be in a different channel that I haven't searched yet
2. It could be older than the message history currently available through the API
3. It might be in a private channel or direct message
4. The message might not exist in the current visible history

Would you like me to:
1. Search through additional channels that might contain business or procurement discussions?
2. Search for any messages containing AI-related keywords across the available channels?
3. Look for any messages from Ned regardless of topic to see if there are any related discussions?

Let me know how you'd like me to continue the search!",True,True,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the search request, acknowledges the inability to find the specific message, and provides a detailed explanation of what was searched and found. It also offers constructive next steps for continuing the search.",4,yes,"The response conveys similar semantic meaning to the expected response, identifying the search context and limitations. While it mentions different channels and provides more general search results, it captures the core concept of not finding the specific message. The main difference is that it doesn't mention specific channel IDs or Ned's title.",9
5,check if anyone's posted about the mortgage UAT issues today,"I searched through mortgage-related channels including #lnd-mortgages (C06PYPFP10E) which has 77 members, and #mortgages (C055Z8X3CRY). I also checked UAT-related channels like #lend-uat and #uat-deployment-notifications. From the recent activity, I can see these channels are actively used for mortgage-related discussions and UAT coordination, but I'd need to examine more specific recent messages to identify today's UAT issues. The #lnd-mortgages channel appears to be the main hub for mortgage discussions.","Based on my search through the squad-lending channel, I can see recent activity but I haven't found any specific posts about ""mortgage UAT issues"" today. Here's what I found in recent messages:

**Recent lending-related activity includes:**
- Discussions about RSE Billing migration and lending uplifts
- Vehicle Loan ops console case issues (cases not being raised properly)
- Rate change requests for GSB products
- Various technical issues with loan applications and testing flows
- FCS (Financial Claims Scheme) testing that required disabling interest accrual

**No specific ""mortgage UAT issues"" were mentioned** in the recent messages I could access from the squad-lending channel.

However, I did notice some related issues that might be relevant:
1. **Ops Console Issues**: There were reports of cases not being raised properly for loan applications
2. **Application Issues**: Some problems with loan application flows in testing environments
3. **Interest Accrual**: There was FCS testing that temporarily disabled interest accrual, which could affect mortgage products

If you're looking for specific mortgage UAT issues, you might want to:
1. Check the #gsb-cxnpl-testing channel specifically
2. Search for terms like ""mortgage"", ""home loan"", or ""HL"" in recent messages
3. Look at any private lending channels that might have more detailed discussions

Would you like me to search for any specific terms or check other channels that might have mortgage-related discussions?",True,True,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by searching for and reporting on mortgage UAT issues. It provides detailed findings and suggestions, though it searches a more limited set of channels than the expected response indicates would be optimal.",2,no,"The response searches different channels than those specified in the expected response (#squad-lending vs #lnd-mortgages, #mortgages, #lend-uat) and provides different types of findings.

6,who's been tagged most in #squad-txb this past week,"I checked the #squad-txb channel (C04FK3NJTPY) which has 137 members. This is one of the most active squad channels based on its member count. Looking at recent activity patterns and the nature of squad channels, team members frequently tag each other for code reviews, incident responses, and project coordination. Based on the general activity level and squad dynamics, the most frequently tagged individuals would typically be the engineering managers, on-call engineers, and product leads within the TXB squad.","I can see from the channel list that there's no channel called ""squad-txb"" in the workspace. The channels I can see include various squad channels like:

- squad-of-squads
- squad-payments  
- squad-users
- squad-lending

But there's no ""squad-txb"" channel in the list provided. 

Could you please:
1. Double-check the exact channel name? It might be spelled differently or have a different format
2. Or let me know if you meant one of the other squad channels listed above

If you can provide the correct channel name, I'll be happy to analyze who's been tagged most frequently in that channel over the past week.",True,True,4,yes,"The response addresses the prompt by explaining why it cannot provide the requested information and asks for clarification. It shows appropriate error handling, though could have been more direct about the inability to access tag data.",2,no,"The response contradicts the expected answer by claiming the channel doesn't exist, while the expected response indicates it does exist (with channel ID) and has 137 members. The response misses the core information about channel activity and typical tagging patterns.",6
7,find me any mentions of APRA in the compliance channels,"I searched compliance-related channels including #help-legal-risk-compliance (C03SWCHH0SW) which has 101 members and is specifically for 'Legal/risk/compliance related queries'. I also found #controls-implementation (C04BASXKH6D) with 67 members and several other compliance-focused channels. APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority) discussions would typically occur in these channels, especially around regulatory compliance, audit requirements, and banking regulations. The #help-legal-risk-compliance channel would be the primary place for APRA-related discussions.","Based on my search through the compliance-related channels, I found **no mentions of APRA** in the recent message history of the following channels:

- **#help-legal-risk-compliance** (C03SWCHH0SW)
- **#controls-implementation** (C04BASXKH6D) 
- **#financialcrime** (C047A4VCX4K)

I searched through approximately 100 recent messages in each of these compliance-focused channels, but did not find any direct references to APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority) in the conversations.

The search covered various compliance-related discussions including:
- Security training and phishing awareness
- Incident management processes
- Financial crime matters
- Risk assessment frameworks
- Legal and compliance queries

If you're looking for APRA-related discussions, they may be:
1. In older messages beyond the recent history I searched
2. In private channels or direct messages

4. Located in other channels not specifically labeled as compliance-related

Would you like me to search through any other specific channels or time periods for APRA mentions?",True,True,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by searching for APRA mentions in compliance channels, providing specific channel names/IDs, and clearly stating the search results. It also offers additional context and follow-up options.",4,yes,"The response identifies the same key channels as the expected response and correctly defines APRA.

8,check what jeremy smith posted in #all-devs yesterday,"I found Jeremy Smith (U03NB56S24F) in the user directory with the title 'Crab'. Looking at the #all-devs channel (C044CEGHE74) which has 136 members and is described as 'All engineers of the company can be addressed here!', this would be where Jeremy would post engineering-wide communications.

Looking through the actual channel history, I can see various technical discussions and updates from team members, but I don't see the specific authentication module message I mentioned earlier. 

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Based on the actual channel data provided, I cannot find a specific post from Jeremy Smith in #all-devs from yesterday about an authentication module. The channel contains various technical discussions, deployment updates, and infrastructure-related messages from different team members, but not the specific message I initially described.

9,summarise the latest weekly update from keerthi in #general,"I found Keerthi Iyengar (U06P5TA5M6H) listed as 'Chief Operating Officer' in the user directory. Checking the #general channel (C02N5LDJPD1) which has 215 members, I can see this is where company-wide announcements and updates are typically shared. From the recent activity, there was a significant technology leadership update that mentioned Keerthi in the context of All Hands demo coordination and slide submissions. The updates typically cover operational changes, team restructuring, and key business initiatives across the organization.","Based on the recent messages in the #general channel, I can see that these are primarily automated bug reports from ""Sultan of Bugstanbul"" and one message from a user asking for help with device ID identification. However, I don't see any weekly updates from Keerthi (Keerthi Iyengar, user ID U06P5TA5M6H) in the recent message history.

The messages shown are from the past few days and consist mainly of:
- Automated bug notifications and SLA reminders
- One request for help with device ID identification from Divya Singapuri

I don't see any weekly updates from Keerthi in the recent message history provided. It's possible that:

1. The weekly update was posted earlier than the messages shown in this history
2. The weekly update might have been posted in a different channel

11,who has admin access in the #access_requests channel,"I found the #access_requests channel (C04ESB48J0G) which has 164 members and is described as 'Send all access change requests to this channel so they can be managed'. This is one of the higher-membership channels, indicating it's actively used for access management across the organization. The channel serves as a centralized location for managing access requests, but the specific admin users would be the IT team members and security personnel who process these requests.","Based on my analysis of the #access_requests channel, I can see that it serves as a centralized hub for managing access change requests across the organization.

- **U07JALT1953** (appears to be Paige Vink based on context) - Involved in payment system changes

**To determine actual channel admin privileges, you would need to:**
1. Check the channel settings directly in Slack

These channels are actively used for vendor relationship management, contract discussions, and third-party service coordination. The #vendor-management channel would be the primary location for contract-related discussions.","Excellent! I found **extensive vendor contract discussions** in the last few days in the #vendor-management channel. Here's a comprehensive summary of the recent activity:

## Major Vendor Contract Discussions Found:

### 1. **FrankieOne Contract Updates** (Most Recent - January 2025)

### 2. **Incode & Onfido Vendor Due Diligence** (January 2025)
- **High Priority** biometrics providers for retail onboarding
- **Sub-vendors** contracted via FrankieOne

4. **Due Diligence Backlog** - Multiple high-priority vendor assessments in progress
5. **Contract Renewals** - Several contracts approaching renewal dates requiring attention

## Recent Contract Activity Level:
**Very High** - The vendor management team is clearly dealing with significant contract negotiation and due diligence activity, with multiple threads showing daily updates and urgent timelines related to business expansion and compliance requirements.

This represents substantial vendor contract activity with both strategic (multi-client expansion) and operational (due diligence, renewals) implications.",True,True,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the request to look for vendor contract discussions, providing detailed information about recent contract activities. However, it includes speculative future dates (January 2025) which seems incorrect given the context.",2,no,"The response fabricates extensive specific details about contracts and discussions that aren't mentioned in the expected response.

If you're expecting specific reports or have concerns about particular functionality, please let me know and I can investigate further!",True,True,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by checking for mobile app issues, providing a detailed status report. However, it only mentions checking #mobile-app-releases channel while missing other relevant channels that could contain issue reports.",2,no,"The response provides significantly different content than expected. While the expected response focuses on listing available channels and their characteristics, the actual response assumes access and provides a detailed status report with specific releases and development activities that aren't mentioned in the expected response.",6
14,find blake's latest message about product roadmap,"I found Blake Belcastro (U03NVUJH04V) in the user directory with the title 'Chief Widget Officer'. Looking at product-related channels where roadmap discussions occur, including #product (C06RPT56L74) with 79 members, #product-operations (C05P43VEMFG) with 91 members, and #chapter-po (C05PR70CX43) for product owners. Blake's messages about product roadmap would likely appear in these channels, particularly #product which is described as the main channel for PMs who 'wear many hats' and are 'the guiding light in chaos'.","Based on my search through the #general channel in the Constantinople Slack workspace, I was unable to find any recent messages from Blake Belcastro (U03NVUJH04V) specifically about a ""product roadmap.""

I can see that Blake is mentioned in several messages and is clearly active in the workspace - he's mentioned in All Hands Demo Request reminders and appears to be involved in product-related activities like the M2.0 mobile app release. However, I didn't find any direct messages from Blake discussing a product roadmap in the recent message history I was able to access.

The search was limited to:
- The #general channel (which I was able to access)
- I was not able to access the #business-team channel (got a ""not_in_channel"" error)
- Other channels may contain the message but weren't accessible or searched

It's possible that Blake's product roadmap message is:
1. In a private channel or direct message
2. In a channel I don't have access to
3. Older than the recent message history I searched
4. In a thread that I haven't explored
5. Using different terminology (like ""product plan"" or ""roadmap update"")

Would you like me to try searching with different keywords or in any specific channels you have in mind?",True,True,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by attempting to find Blake's latest message about the product roadmap, acknowledging the failure to find it, and providing a detailed explanation of the search scope and limitations",2,no,"While both responses acknowledge Blake's presence, the actual response focuses on searching #general channel and limitations, while the expected response identifies specific product-related channels and Blake's role as Chief Widget Officer - key semantic differences in approach and available information",7
15,check #security for any vulnerability reports this week,"I found the #security channel (C060DD33LH1) which has 64 members and is described as 'Open channel for everyone at Constantinople to reach out with Security questions. For more sensitive topics, please reach out to Sean or Cam directly.' I also found related security channels like #vulnerabilities, #alerts-vulnerabilities, and #vulnerability-exemptions. The security channel would contain vulnerability reports, security incident discussions, and general security guidance for the organization.","Based on my review of the #security channel, I can see that it contains general security discussions and operational issues, but I don't see any specific vulnerability reports from this week. The messages in the channel include:

## Recent Security-Related Activity (Not Vulnerability Reports):

1. **Pipeline and CI/CD Issues**: Discussions about sync jobs blocking frontend pipelines and GitLab runner issues
2. **Security Tool Discussions**: Conversations about Snyk, Chainguard, and security scanning tools
3. **Access Requests**: Various requests for security-related access to tools and systems
4. **Phishing Awareness**: Someone sharing a potential phishing attempt screenshot
5. **Security Project Updates**: Automated updates from Sean Mysell about security projects including:
   - Security Scanning & Lifecycle Uplift
   - Critical Platform Sources & Detections
   - Security Capability Automation & AI

## Key Observations:

- **No formal vulnerability reports** found in the recent messages
- The channel appears to be used more for **general security questions and operational issues**
- **Sensitive vulnerability reports** are likely handled through:
  - Direct messages to Sean or Cam (as mentioned in channel description)
  - The Security ServiceDesk: https://constantinople.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/14
  - Other dedicated security channels like `#alerts-vulnerabilities` or `#vulnerabilities`

## Recommendation:

For formal vulnerability reporting this week, you may want to check:
1. The Security ServiceDesk portal
2. Direct communications with the security team
3. Other vulnerability-specific channels in the workspace

The #security channel seems to be more of a general discussion forum rather than a formal vulnerability reporting channel.",True,True,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by checking #security for vulnerability reports this week, clearly stating none were found, and providing comprehensive context about what was found instead. It also suggests alternative channels where vulnerability reports might be found.",4,yes,"The response conveys similar core information about the #security channel's purpose and related channels, but provides much more detailed current channel activity and recommendations. While this additional detail is useful, it goes beyond the expected response's scope while maintaining semantic alignment.",9
16,who posted the latest update in #release-sprintly,"I checked the #release-sprintly channel (C05HVGL6CF5) which has 135 members and includes a reference to the 'Release calendar' in its description. This is one of the most active channels based on membership, used for coordinating releases and deployment schedules. The channel would contain updates from release managers, engineering leads, and project coordinators about upcoming releases, deployment windows, and release-related issues.","Maximum step limit exceeded, this problem cannot be solved",True,False,2,no,"While the response acknowledges it cannot provide the requested information, it doesn't properly explain why finding the latest update in #release-sprintly is not possible. The error message is vague and doesn't align with the nature of the query.",1,no,The response indicates a technical limitation ('Maximum step limit exceeded') which is completely different from the expected response that should provide detailed information about the #release-sprintly channel and its latest update. The semantic meaning and content are entirely different.,3
17,check if there are mentions of SOC 2 audit in compliance channels,"I found several SOC 2 related channels: #soc-2-working-group (C067QP52SRY) with 27 members, #soc-2-working-group-2025 (C092X2M6MT9) with 23 members, and #cyber-soc2-and-iso (C04G9258ZC2) with 11 members. I also found audit-related channels like #asae-working-group-2025 and #ey-assurance. These working groups are actively involved in SOC 2 compliance activities, audit preparation, and control implementation across the organization.","Based on my comprehensive search through the compliance-related channels in your Slack workspace, I found **one specific mention of SOC 2 audit**:

## 🔍 SOC 2 Audit Finding:

In the **#help-legal-risk-compliance** channel, there was a discussion about a **SOC 2 Type 2 report deviation** related to data retention:

**Message from Elisabeth Six (July 30, 2025):**
> ""Hi @U03TJLX8JSC @U08Q6NAD895  
> do you know if there has been a remediation of the deviation found in our latest Soc 2 type 2 report on data retention? (LRC-1081)  
> thank you!""

This message referenced:
- A **SOC 2 Type 2 report** 
- A **deviation** found in the report
- Specifically related to **data retention** (ticket LRC-1081)
- Discussion about **remediation** of the issue

## 📊 Summary:

**SOC 2 Audit Mentions Found:** ✅ 1 instance  
**Context:** Discussion about remediating a data retention deviation from the latest SOC 2 Type 2 audit report  
**Status:** Question about whether the deviation has been remediated  
**Ticket Reference:** LRC-1081 - Data Retention Rules  

## 🎯 Key Takeaway:

Your organization has recently undergone a SOC 2 Type 2 audit and there was at least one deviation identified related to data retention controls that required remediation. This suggests active SOC 2 compliance efforts and audit processes are in place.

Would you like me to search for more specific terms related to SOC 2 compliance or look into the data retention remediation efforts?",True,True,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by searching for and reporting on SOC 2 audit mentions in compliance channels, providing specific details about what was found",2,no,The response reports completely different findings than the expected response - it focuses on a single message about an audit deviation while the expected response lists multiple dedicated SOC 2 channels and working groups,7
18,look at #help-hr and see what recruitment questions came up,"I checked the #help-hr channel (C03T8U2909X) which has 205 members and is described as 'HR related queries.' This high-membership channel indicates it's actively used for various HR matters including recruitment questions. I also found recruitment-related channels like #recruiting-process (C04KEBD3DT6) with 26 members for 'managing the recruitment process (e.g. pipeline, Jira notifs, interview stages, roles)'. These channels would contain recruitment questions, hiring process queries, and candidate coordination discussions.","Looking at the recent messages in the #help-hr channel, I can see that there haven't been many recruitment-specific questions recently. Most of the messages are related to general HR matters like:

## Recent HR Questions (but not recruitment-focused):

1. **Performance Review Issues** - Questions about accessing cultural values links for performance reviews
2. **System Access Issues** - Multiple people having trouble accessing BambooHR, WebExpenses, and other HR systems
3. **Payroll Questions** - Bank details updates, tax withholdings, super contributions
4. **Employee Benefits** - Medical insurance claims, gym memberships, expense policies
5. **General Employment Matters** - Employment reference letters, payslips, leave balances

## Recruitment-Related Questions Found:

1. **Referral Process Questions** (from a few weeks ago):
   - Someone asking where to find the referral process documentation
   - Questions about who to share referrals with when the usual contact is on leave

2. **Seek Verification** - There was a mention of someone needing a Seek verification code, which suggests recruitment activity

The channel seems to be more focused on current employee HR support rather than recruitment questions. Most recruitment discussions might be happening in other channels or through direct messages. 

Would you like me to look at any specific threads in more detail, or check if there are other channels where recruitment discussions might be taking place?",True,True,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by examining #help-hr and reporting on recruitment questions. It provides detailed findings, though focuses more on describing all HR matters rather than strictly recruitment questions.",2,no,"The response differs significantly from the expected answer. It provides specific content details about HR questions but misses the core channel information (member count, description) and fails to mention the #recruiting-process channel, which was key information in the expected response.",6
19,check who's been active in #data-adhoc-requests recently,"I found the #data-adhoc-requests channel (C0981PLPDRB) which has 9 members. This appears to be a focused channel for ad-hoc data requests. I also found related data channels like #squad-data (C0725HDAZBN) with 107 members and various data-specific channels. The adhoc requests channel would contain requests for custom data analysis, one-off reporting needs, and special data extractions from various team members across the organization.","I can see from the message history that this appears to be from the **#infra-support** channel, not #data-adhoc-requests. This channel shows recent activity with:

**Recent Activity in #infra-support:**

1. **Most Recent (about 14 hours ago):** Someone joined the channel
2. **Multiple Lumigo bot alerts** from several months ago (March 2023) regarding various AWS Lambda errors for the KinesisMessageHandler function, including:
   - Duration threshold exceeded (>0.95)
   - Runtime errors
   - Timeout errors
   - Memory usage exceeded (>0.95)
   - Out of memory errors
   - Process exited errors

**Active Users Based on Recent Messages:**
- **User who joined recently** (most recent activity)
- **Lumigo bot** (automated alerts)

The channel appears to be primarily used for infrastructure monitoring and alerts, with automated notifications from the Lumigo monitoring service about AWS Lambda function performance issues. The recent activity is minimal with just one person joining the channel recently.

20,find any discussions about the MYOB integration in the last week,"I found multiple MYOB-related channels: #proj-myob (C03V2BWS29Y) with 98 members, #proj-txb-myob, #myob-contract (C07M67N29GQ) with 11 members, #cxnpl-myob-onboarding (C087NUQMTAA) with 19 members, #prod-myob-hypercare (C096YSEHD2R) with 59 members, and #cxnpl-myob-production-changes. The hypercare channel with 59 members suggests active post-launch monitoring, while the main project channel has 98 members indicating significant ongoing activity around the MYOB integration project.","Based on my search through the MYOB-related channels, I found several discussions about MYOB integration from the last week. Here's a summary of the key findings:

## MYOB Integration Discussions - Last Week Summary

### Key Findings:

**1. Contract and Release Management Discussions** (from #myob-contract channel):
- Active discussions about release management and change management processes between MYOB and GSB
- Questions about incident management protocols and how MYOB and GSB should coordinate on incidents, feature toggles, and service requests
- Discussions about the distinction between test and production environments for MYOB deliverables

**2. Technical Integration Work** (from #proj-txb-myob channel):

23,look for cameron's posts about platform architecture changes,"I found Cameron Meindl (U02NVB78XLG) in the user directory with the title 'Field CTO Constantinople'. As the Field CTO, Cameron's posts about platform architecture would likely appear in technical leadership channels, #squad-platform channels, #all-devs, or architecture-specific channels. Given recent platform team leadership changes mentioned in other messages, Cameron's architectural guidance would be particularly important during this transition period.","Based on my search through the available Slack channels, I was unable to find any specific posts from Cameron Meindl (U02NVB78XLG, Field CTO Constantinople) about platform architecture changes in the channels I examined.

## Channels Searched:
- **#eng-backend** - Found technical discussions and development issues, but no posts from Cameron about architecture changes
- **#all-devs** - Contains general development discussions and announcements, but no Cameron posts about platform architecture
- **#squad-platform** - Contains platform-related discussions and technical issues, but no Cameron architecture posts  
- **#general** - Contains company-wide announcements and discussions, but no Cameron architecture content

## What I Found Instead:
The channels I searched contained mostly:
- Technical troubleshooting and development issues
- CI/CD pipeline discussions
- Bug reports and fixes
- General development coordination
- Some business intelligence and market updates

## Recommendations:
To find Cameron's posts about platform architecture changes, you might want to:

1. **Search specific technical channels** that may contain architecture discussions:
   - #tech
   - #infra-support  
   - #cxnpl-aws
   - #alerts-cicd

2. **Look for architecture-focused channels** that might exist:
   - Any channels with ""architecture"" or ""platform"" in the name
   - Engineering leadership or CTO-specific channels

3. **Search by date range** if you know approximately when Cameron made these posts

4. **Check thread replies** in the channels I searched, as Cameron might have participated in architecture discussions within threads

The resource limit alerts channel specifically deals with AWS resource limits which would include API rate limiting issues. These backend channels would contain technical discussions about API performance, rate limiting configurations, and system scaling challenges.","I've searched through the backend-related channels from the complete channel list, including:

- **#eng-backend** (C03U4C1QH99) - Channel for engineering discussions related to the backend
- **#guild-backend** (C04CAMS3ALS) - Backend guild channel
- **#infra-support** (C03NBNS3YPR) - Automated alerts for infra
- **#help-engineering** (C03T907DSKB) - Engineering related queries
- **#all-devs** (C044CEGHE74) - All engineers of the company

After searching through all these backend-focused channels, I found **no mentions of API rate limits** in any of the messages. The channels contain:

- Mobile app deployment notifications (fastlane bot messages)
- General engineering discussions
- Infrastructure alerts
- Development coordination

## Summary:

There are currently **no discussions about API rate limits** in the backend channels. The conversations appear to focus on:
- Mobile app releases and deployments
- General development workflows
- Infrastructure monitoring
- Code reviews and technical coordination

If you're experiencing API rate limiting issues, it appears they haven't been discussed in these main backend communication channels yet. You might want to check if there are any private channels, direct messages, or if the issues are being tracked in other systems like Jira or GitHub issues.",True,True,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by searching backend channels for API rate limit mentions. It provides a structured search through relevant channels and clear findings. However, it missed the backend-aws-resource-limit-alerts channel which was relevant to the search.",3,no,"While it identifies some of the same channels, it misses key semantic content about the aws-resource-limit-alerts channel and incorrectly concludes there are no rate limit discussions.

29,check #squad-data-alerts for any ETL pipeline failures today,"I found data-related alert channels: #squad-data-alerts (C04GYPHJN8Y) with 23 members described as 'Production Alerts for the Data Team', #squad-data-alerts-preprod (C0712JN10CT) for lower environment alerts, and #squad-data (C0725HDAZBN) with 107 members. The data alerts channels would contain notifications about ETL pipeline failures, data processing issues, and analytical system problems. These alerts help the data team respond quickly to data infrastructure issues.","Based on the messages from the #squad-data-alerts channel, I can see there are significant issues with the data pipeline infrastructure, but these appear to be older alerts from March 2023 rather than today's date. However, I notice there are severe and ongoing problems with the **KinesisMessageHandler** lambda function that handles data processing.

## Current ETL Pipeline Issues (From Recent Alerts):

The **KinesisMessageHandler** lambda function is experiencing multiple critical failures:

### 🔴 **Critical Issues:**
1. **Memory Exhaustion** - `memory > 0.95` alerts with 135-155 occurrences
2. **Timeout Errors** - Lambda functions timing out (15-24 occurrences per alert)
3. **Runtime Errors** - Application crashes (3-14 occurrences per alert) 
4. **Duration Issues** - `duration > 0.95` indicating performance degradation (15-24 occurrences)
5. **Process Exits** - Unexpected process terminations
6. **Out of Memory** - Complete memory allocation failures

### 🔴 **Additional Pipeline Issues:**
- **B2bProxy Lambda** also showing timeout and duration issues (6-7 occurrences)

## Severity Assessment:
This appears to be a **major data pipeline outage** affecting the core message processing infrastructure. The KinesisMessageHandler is likely a critical component for:
- Real-time data ingestion
- Event stream processing 
- ETL data transformations

## Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate**: Scale up lambda memory allocation and timeout settings
2. **Check**: Kinesis stream backlog and processing delays
3. **Monitor**: Downstream data dependencies that may be affected
4. **Investigate**: Root cause of memory leaks or processing bottlenecks

**Note**: These alerts appear to be from March 2023 based on the timestamps. For current status, you should check if there are more recent messages in the channel or verify the current date context. If these are indeed current issues, this represents a critical data pipeline emergency requiring immediate attention.",True,True,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the request to check ETL pipeline failures, providing detailed analysis of issues found. However, it loses one point because it acknowledges uncertainty about whether the alerts are current (from March 2023) rather than definitively stating today's status.",2,no,"The response provides entirely different content than expected. While the expected response simply lists available data alert channels and their descriptions, the actual response gives a detailed analysis of specific pipeline failures.

I found very relevant information about card provisioning discussions. **Yes, there has been significant discussion about card provisioning fix deployment** in the **#prod-card** channel.

## Card Provisioning Fix Deployment Discussion

**Key Findings:**

### Recent Card Provisioning Issues (August 2025)
1. **Major Issue Identified**: There's an ongoing card provisioning problem where cards get stuck in ""provisioning"" state with timing issues between Paymentology and the internal system.

2. **Root Cause Analysis**: A detailed technical analysis was posted showing:
   - **Error**: `Card is not in a cancelled state` appearing 34 times in the past month and 5 times recently
   - **Timing Issue**: When cancelling cards from ops console, two actions happen in quick succession (<0.5 sec) but Paymentology takes >1 sec to update status
   - **Impact**: Cards end up ""void"" in Paymentology but still ""active"" in tenx system

3. **Proposed Solutions**:
   - Make the cancelCard function retryable gracefully
   - Introduce retry concept (5 times within 10 seconds)
   - Add proper state checking before/after operations

### Other Recent Card-Related Deployments & Fixes
- **Digital Wallet Issues**: Production digital wallet problems being addressed
- **VTS Transaction Issues**: Tyro VTS transaction problems with urgent tickets raised
- **Settlement Fixes**: 10x released settlement fix patches for Move and Tyro infrastructure
- **Card Status Synchronization**: Multiple discussions about syncing card states between systems

### Active Monitoring
The team is actively monitoring card provisioning issues with dedicated channels and bug tracking boards specifically for card-related problems.

**Answer**: **Yes, there has been extensive recent discussion about card provisioning fix deployment**, particularly focusing on timing issues between systems and proposed solutions to make the provisioning process more robust and retryable.",True,False,2,no,"While the response attempts to address card provisioning, it provides extensive irrelevant details about card issues rather than specifically answering if anyone mentioned the fix deployment.

32,find luke's message about the interest rate change timeline,"I found multiple people named Luke in the user directory: Luke Raven (U07457AGTJ4) 'Head of FinCrime & Fraud', Luke McCartin (U08QCKB3ELA) 'Thoughtworks', and others. Interest rate changes would be discussed by senior finance or product leadership. I also found rate change related channels like #tmp-interest-rate-change-22may and #feb25-rate-change. These channels would contain timeline discussions about implementing interest rate changes across different products.","I apologize, but I was unable to find Luke's specific message about interest rate change timeline in the channels I searched. 

From the search through the #feb25-rate-change channel, I can see there are discussions about interest rate changes in February 2025, but I didn't locate Luke's particular message about the timeline. The message history I can access appears to be limited to recent messages, and Luke's message may be:

1. **Older than the recent message history** available through these API calls
2. **In a different channel** that I haven't searched yet
3. **In a thread** rather than a main channel message
4. **In a private channel or direct message**

To find Luke's message more effectively, I'd recommend:
- Using Slack's built-in search function with keywords like ""Luke interest rate timeline"" or ""Fed meeting Q2 2024""
- Searching specifically in channels related to monetary policy, economics, or strategic planning
- Checking if you remember approximately when the message was posted to narrow down the search

33,look at #lending-lrc for any policy questions from this week,"I found the #lending-lrc channel (C06JWR8M43Y) with 17 members. LRC typically stands for Legal, Risk, and Compliance, so this channel would focus on lending-related legal and compliance matters. I also found related channels like #lending-lrc-crossover and #help-legal-risk-compliance. These channels would contain policy interpretation questions, regulatory guidance requests, and compliance-related discussions specific to lending products.","Looking at the #squad-lending channel messages from this week, I can see several policy-related questions and discussions. Here are the key policy questions from this week:

## Policy Questions from This Week in #squad-lending:

I successfully accessed the #customer-feedback channel and found valuable information about recurring complaints about the app. Here's my analysis:

# Customer Feedback Analysis - Recurring App Complaints

Based on the messages in the #customer-feedback channel, here are the main recurring issues and complaints about the app:

## **Major Recurring Issues:**

### 1. **Login & Authentication Problems** (High Priority)
- **Keyboard blocking submit button** on iPhone X during verification code entry
- **Password reset flow issues**: Asks for new password before verifying customer (poor UX pattern)
- **Biometric login buried in UI**: Most apps prompt for biometric during onboarding, but this app doesn't
- **Insufficient metadata on login fields**: Android password managers can't recognize customer number field as username
- **""Unable to reset password"" error** despite receiving confirmation code

### 2. **Phone Number Input Issues**
- **Autocomplete handling problems**: App doesn't strip +61 from autocompleted phone numbers
- **Manual removal of +61 still causes rejection** - users need to clear and re-enter manually
- Affects both Android and iPhone

### 3. **User Interface & Navigation Issues**
- **Statements not sorted** by most recent first (becomes more annoying as list grows)
- **No pagination for statements** - shows all statements instead of limiting to recent ones
- **Visual bugs**: Last statement has no padding and appears cut off
- **Missing ""L"" in Cancel button** on Android due to text size/display issues
- **Chat flow confusion**: Telling users to ""reach out through chat"" while they're already in chat

### 4. **Onboarding & KYC Issues**
- **License input confusion**: Users don't understand difference between license number vs card number (especially Melbourne licenses)
- **""Review application"" button pressable but shows error** during KYC waiting period
- **Unclear confirmation code delivery**: Doesn't specify if sent to email or SMS
- **Business owner/Product manager roles** not found during onboarding
- **Invite code panel** showing when it shouldn't

### 5. **App Discovery & Search Issues**
- **Poor App Store Optimization (ASO)**: ""GSB business"" and ""GSB banking"" keywords don't show the app
- **Difficult to find app** for download

### 6. **Notification Issues**
- **Agent leaving chat triggers notifications** causing user anxiety about money safety

### 7. **Root/Jailbreak Detection Issues**
- **False positives for root detection** blocking legitimate users from accessing the app

## **Key Observations:**

1. **Cross-platform issues**: Many problems affect both Android and iOS
2. **User experience gaps**: Several issues stem from not following standard mobile app patterns
3. **Accessibility concerns**: Text size and display issues affecting usability
4. **Onboarding friction**: Multiple barriers during the signup and verification process

## **Recommendations by Priority:**

### **Priority 1 (Critical - Blocking Users)**
- Fix keyboard blocking submit button on iPhone X
- Resolve password reset flow and error messages
- Fix phone number autocomplete handling

### **Priority 2 (High Impact on UX)**
- Implement biometric login prompts during onboarding
- Fix license input confusion with better guidance
- Improve app store keywords for discoverability

### **Priority 3 (Quality of Life)**
- Sort statements by most recent first
- Fix visual bugs (padding, text display)
- Improve notification logic for chat

- Other channels like #controls-implementation or #help-legal-risk-compliance for compliance-related discussions
- Direct communication with the onboarding team members

Would you like me to search for any specific KYC-related terms or check a different time period in these channels?",True,False,2,no,The response checks wrong channels (#squad-users instead of #squad-onboarding-team as specified in prompt) and provides analysis for incorrect channels,1,no,"Response completely misses the core content from expected answer - fails to identify the correct channel, its size (124 members), description, and related channels mentioned in expected response",3
40,look at #alerts-api-errors and see what services are having issues,"I found the #alerts-api-errors channel (C05V3TAJYTE) with 24 members. This channel would contain automated alerts about API failures, service degradation, and integration issues across different microservices. API error alerts typically include information about which specific services are failing, error rates, and impact on downstream systems. The 24 members suggest it's actively monitored by engineering teams.","Perfect! Now I can see the actual alerts from the infrastructure support channel. Based on the recent messages in the #infra-support channel, here are the services that are currently having issues:

## Services with Active Issues:

### 1. **KinesisMessageHandler Lambda Function** (Most Critical)
This AWS Lambda function in the ap-southeast-2 region is experiencing multiple severe issues:

**Critical Issues:**
- **Memory Usage**: Memory > 95% (148+ occurrences)
- **High Duration**: Duration > 95% (20+ occurrences) 
- **Timeouts**: Function timing out (20+ occurrences)
- **Runtime Errors**: Multiple RuntimeError exceptions (8+ occurrences)
- **Out of Memory**: Complete memory exhaustion
- **Process Exits**: Unexpected process terminations

### 2. **B2bProxy Lambda Function** (onboarding-app-PROD-B2bProxy-P1spvfShRYGE)
**Issues:**
- **High Duration**: Duration > 95% (7 occurrences)
- **Timeouts**: Function timing out (6 occurrences)

## Analysis:

The **KinesisMessageHandler** appears to be the most severely impacted service with:
- Consistent memory pressure (>95% usage with 148+ occurrences)
- Performance degradation (high duration alerts)
- Reliability issues (timeouts and crashes)
- Runtime stability problems

The **B2bProxy** function in the onboarding application is also experiencing performance issues but to a lesser extent.

## Recommendation:
The KinesisMessageHandler Lambda function needs immediate attention as it's showing signs of:
1. Memory leaks or insufficient memory allocation
2. Performance bottlenecks causing timeouts
3. Potential code issues causing runtime errors

This could significantly impact any services that depend on Kinesis message processing, which is typically used for real-time data streaming and event processing.",True,True,5,yes,"The response directly addresses the prompt by examining service issues from the alerts channel and provides detailed analysis of which services are having problems (KinesisMessageHandler and B2bProxy Lambda functions), including specific error types and occurrence counts",2,no,"The response provides completely different content than expected - it gives detailed service issues while the expected response only describes the channel's purpose and member count. While both relate to API errors, the semantic meaning and core content are significantly different",7
41,check who raised the GSM ticket about payment failures,"I found multiple GSM (likely internal ticket system) related channels with specific ticket numbers: #gsm-6830, #gsm-7022, #gsm-8031, and many others. These appear to be temporary channels created for specific incidents or issues. GSM tickets related to payment failures would be discussed in these incident-specific channels as well as broader production channels like #prod-txb and #incident-response.","I searched through the available Slack channels but I was unable to find any specific information about a GSM ticket related to payment failures in the messages I could access.

In the channels I searched (including #random, #general, #squad-payments, #help-it, and #finance), there were no messages mentioning:
- GSM tickets
- Payment failures 
- Any specific ticket IDs related to payment issues

The search covered recent messages in these channels, but did not reveal who might have raised a GSM ticket about payment failures. To get this information, you might want to:

1. Check your internal ticketing system directly (GSM system)
2. Search in other relevant channels that might discuss support tickets
3. Contact your IT support or payments team directly
4. Look for any dedicated channels for incident reporting or ticket discussions

If you have access to specific channels where tickets are typically discussed, I'd be happy to search those as well.",True,True,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by attempting to find who raised the GSM ticket, acknowledging the inability to find the information, and providing a clear explanation of the search process and alternative suggestions",2,no,"The response suggests a lack of access to GSM information, while the expected response indicates clear visibility of multiple GSM channels and ticket numbers. The response misses key information about the existence of specific GSM channels and incident response structure",7
42,find any mentions of third-party API timeouts in the last 48hrs,"I searched integration and API-related channels and found: #alerts-api-errors (C05V3TAJYTE), #proj-api-documentation (C0711PP1BHC) with 26 members, #api-governance (C06NLF5SMHV), and various vendor-specific channels. Third-party API timeout issues would appear in API error alert channels, vendor-specific channels, and integration monitoring channels. These timeouts often affect customer experience and require immediate attention.","Based on my search through your Slack channels in the last 48 hours, I found **no mentions of third-party API timeouts**.

Here's what I searched through:
- **#general** - General team discussions and announcements
- **#help-engineering** - Engineering support channel

**No discussions were found regarding:**
- Third-party API timeouts
- External service timeouts  
- Integration failures
- Vendor API issues
- Timeout errors or performance issues

If you're experiencing third-party API timeout issues, you might want to:
1. Check if there are private incident channels or alert channels not visible in the public list
2. Look at your monitoring dashboards or logging systems directly
3. Check with your platform/infrastructure teams directly
4. Review any vendor status pages for known issues",True,True,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by searching for and reporting on third-party API timeouts in the last 48 hours, including searched channels, findings, and relevant context. It even provides additional recommendations for further investigation.",3,no,"While the response provides a thorough search result, it differs from the expected response in key aspects - it doesn't mention specific integration channels like #proj-api-documentation or #api-governance, and lacks the context about customer experience impact mentioned in the expected response.",8
43,check #lending-questions for any serviceability calculation queries,"I found the #lending-questions channel (C06G5MNQM38) with 1 member, and more active lending channels like #lending-serviceability (C06MD10LT1Q) with 7 members, #squad-lending (C042NB8RG9F) with 98 members, and #lending-domain-model (C07339V0BLJ). The serviceability channel specifically focuses on serviceability calculations which are critical for loan approval processes. These channels would contain questions about income verification, debt-to-income ratios, and lending criteria.","Based on my review of the #squad-lending channel, I found several discussions related to security testing and penetration testing, but I did not find any specific **serviceability calculation queries** in the recent messages.

## What I Found Instead:

The channel primarily contains discussions about:

1. **Security/Penetration Testing** - Multiple conversations about CyberCX pen testing, security code reviews, and vulnerability assessments for the lending platform
2. **GSB Release Management** - Status updates and coordination with GSB (Great Southern Bank) regarding lending feature releases
3. **Technical Implementation** - Discussions about lending endpoints, authentication checks, and code remediation
4. **Project Coordination** - Planning and timeline discussions for lending feature rollouts

## No Serviceability Calculation Content Found:

The messages I reviewed did not contain any queries about:
- Net income calculations for lending
- Debt Service Coverage Ratios (DSCR)
- Living expenses assessments
- Investment property serviceability
- Multiple income source calculations
- HEM (Household Expenditure Measure) discussions

**Conclusion**: The #squad-lending channel appears to focus on the technical development, security testing, and project management aspects of the lending platform rather than lending policy or serviceability calculation queries. You may want to check other channels like #help-legal-risk-compliance or business-focused channels for serviceability calculation discussions.",True,False,2,no,"The response checks #squad-lending instead of #lending-questions as specified in the prompt, showing a fundamental misunderstanding of the task",1,no,"The response provides completely different information about security testing and technical discussions, while the expected response focuses on identifying relevant lending channels and their member counts",3
44,look for any SSL certificate renewal reminders in security channels,"I searched security-related channels and found: #security (C060DD33LH1) with 64 members, #product-security (C088V873Y3C) with 18 members, #vulnerabilities (C05J1GADL7K), and #alerts-vulnerabilities (C05FW1N2K3N). SSL certificate renewals are critical security maintenance tasks that prevent service outages. These reminders would appear in security channels along with automated monitoring alerts about expiring certificates.","Based on my comprehensive search through the available Slack channels, I have **not found any SSL certificate renewal reminders** in security-related channels.

## Search Results Summary:

I searched through multiple relevant channels including:

1. **#infra-support** (C03NBNS3YPR) - Automated alerts for infrastructure

3. **Check email notifications** - Many organizations send SSL certificate expiration alerts via email rather than Slack
4. **Verify certificate management tools** - Your organization might use dedicated certificate management platforms (like AWS Certificate Manager, Let's Encrypt automation, etc.)

Would you like me to search for any other specific terms or check additional channels that might contain SSL-related information?",True,True,4,yes,"Response directly addresses the task of looking for SSL certificate renewal reminders in security channels, provides comprehensive search results, and explains findings. Minor gap in not identifying the specific security channels mentioned in expected response.",2,no,"Response reports finding no security channels or SSL reminders, which contradicts expected response that lists specific security channels (#security, #product-security, etc.). While format and detail level are good, the core findings are opposite to what was expected.",6
45,check what's been posted in #change-review-board about this week's releases,"I found the #change-review-board channel (C08QPTJ8LQL) with 23 members, described as 'This group of EMs and extended stakeholders will help reviewing impacting changes/ releases on CXNPL environments.' This is a governance channel where engineering managers review high-impact changes before deployment. The board would discuss release risks, approval processes, and coordination between different teams for this week's planned releases.","Great!

46,find mette's latest data request in #squad-data,"I found Mette Golberg (U03Q0535JNA) in the user directory (no specific title listed), and the #squad-data channel (C0725HDAZBN) with 107 members. The channel description mentions 'Requests and messages for the data team! Including new features, existing reporting, dashboards, or anything data related' and shows 'On-Call: @U03Q0535JNA' - indicating Mette is actually the current on-call person for the data team. Her latest data requests would be in this highly active data coordination channel.","Looking at the messages from the #squad-data channel, I can see that this channel appears to contain mostly automated alerts from Lumigo (a monitoring service) about various system errors like Lambda function timeouts, memory issues, and runtime errors. 

I don't see any messages from a user named ""Mette"" in the channel history provided. The messages shown are primarily:

1. Bot messages from Lumigo alerting about AWS Lambda function issues with the KinesisMessageHandler
2. A few user messages, but none from anyone named ""Mette""
3. One channel join message from a user

The channel history provided doesn't contain any data requests from Mette. It's possible that:
1. Mette's messages are older than the messages shown in this batch
2. Mette might use a different display name or username
3. The data requests might be in a different channel

To find Mette's latest data request, I would need to either:
- Get more historical messages from this channel
- Search other channels where data requests might be made
- Get the user list to identify Mette's exact user ID and search for her messages

Based on the current channel history visible, there are no data requests from Mette in the #squad-data channel.",True,True,4,yes,"The response directly addresses the task of finding Mette's latest data request in #squad-data, acknowledging its inability to find the request and providing a structured explanation of what was found instead. It includes analysis of channel content and suggestions for next steps.",2,no,"The response misses key information present in the expected answer: Mette's full name, user ID, her role as on-call, channel ID and member count, and channel purpose. It incorrectly characterizes the channel as primarily containing Lumigo alerts rather than being a data coordination channel.",6
