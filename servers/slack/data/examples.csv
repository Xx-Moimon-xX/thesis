"Please help me write a response to this message. I need to convey that if you want to build a feature where you raise a case manually in the ops console, you must create the initiation logic/screens manually. There is no generic way to do this as each case is custom. The old connect case template way of doing this is deprecated because it is prone to error and takes a lot of manual effort to copy IDs across and the like.  \n  \nPlease refer to the confluence document: Case management in the ops console  \n  \nHey team,  \n In the Ops Console, if an Ops person needs to raise a case using the case management flow by selecting a template — we’d need to create a new template for that, right?  \nAlso, based on the document below, it looks like the case is created from Bosphorus (backend) and is just being displayed in the Ops Console. Can someone please confirm?  \n  \nhttps://constantinople.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CXNPLPREPROJ/pages/702546211/Case+Management+in+the+Ops+Console#Case.1"
