You are an AI assistant tasked with creating a synthetic dataset for a thesis project. Your goal is to generate realistic synthetic inputs that simulate how real employees and users might interact with an AI system using external tools. 

Some examples of real user inputs are in the given csv file, take inspiration from this when you are creating your inputs.

Here are the tools available:

<tool_descriptions>
Tool(name='slack_list_channels', title=None, description='List public or pre-defined channels in the workspace with pagination', inputSchema={'type': 'object', 'properties': {'limit': {'type': 'number', 'description': 'Maximum number of channels to return (default 100, max 200)', 'default': 100}, 'cursor': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Pagination cursor for next page of results'}}}, outputSchema=None, annotations=None, meta=None), Tool(name='slack_get_channel_history', title=None, description='Get recent messages from a channel', inputSchema={'type': 'object', 'properties': {'channel_id': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The ID of the channel'}, 'limit': {'type': 'number', 'description': 'Number of messages to retrieve (default 10)', 'default': 10}}, 'required': ['channel_id']}, outputSchema=None, annotations=None, meta=None), Tool(name='slack_get_thread_replies', title=None, description='Get all replies in a message thread', inputSchema={'type': 'object', 'properties': {'channel_id': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The ID of the channel containing the thread'}, 'thread_ts': {'type': 'string', 'description': "The timestamp of the parent message in the format '1234567890.123456'. Timestamps in the format without the period can be converted by adding the period such that 6 numbers come after it."}}, 'required': ['channel_id', 'thread_ts']}, outputSchema=None, annotations=None, meta=None), Tool(name='slack_get_users', title=None, description='Get a list of all users in the workspace with their basic profile information', inputSchema={'type': 'object', 'properties': {'cursor': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Pagination cursor for next page of results'}, 'limit': {'type': 'number', 'description': 'Maximum number of users to return (default 100, max 200)', 'default': 100}}}, outputSchema=None, annotations=None, meta=None), Tool(name='slack_get_user_profile', title=None, description='Get detailed profile information for a specific user', inputSchema={'type': 'object', 'properties': {'user_id': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The ID of the user'}}, 'required': ['user_id']}, outputSchema=None, annotations=None, meta=None)]
</tool_descriptions>

Your task is to create 5 synthetic inputs along with the tool calls that would be required to obtain the answer for each input. Each synthetic input should be a realistic query or request that a user might make, utilizing one or more of the available Slack tools.

Output each synthetic input in JSONL format with the following attributes:
- unique_id: A unique identifier for each input (starting from 1)
- Prompt: The synthetic user input or query
- Answer: Leave this empty
- Tool Calls: An array of tool names that would be called to answer the prompt

Format example:
{"unique_id": 1, "Prompt": "Get slack channels in the workspace", "Answer": "", "Tool Calls": ["slack_list_channels"]}

Guidelines for creating diverse and realistic inputs:
1. Vary the complexity of queries, from simple requests to more complex multi-step processes.
2. Include scenarios that require multiple tool calls to complete a task.
3. Use realistic language and phrasing that a typical user might employ.
4. Cover a range of use cases for each tool, exploring different parameters and combinations.
5. Include some edge cases or less common scenarios to add variety.

Now, generate 5 unique synthetic inputs following the guidelines and format provided above. Ensure that each input is realistic, diverse, and utilizes the available Slack tools appropriately. Present your output as a series of JSONL formatted entries, one per line.

You are an AI assistant tasked with creating a synthetic dataset for a thesis project. Your goal is to generate realistic synthetic inputs that simulate how real employees and users might interact with an AI system using Slack-related tools.

First, carefully review the following tool descriptions:

<tool_descriptions>
Tool(name='slack_list_channels', title=None, description='List public or pre-defined channels in the workspace with pagination', inputSchema={'type': 'object', 'properties': {'limit': {'type': 'number', 'description': 'Maximum number of channels to return (default 100, max 200)', 'default': 100}, 'cursor': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Pagination cursor for next page of results'}}}, outputSchema=None, annotations=None, meta=None), Tool(name='slack_get_channel_history', title=None, description='Get recent messages from a channel', inputSchema={'type': 'object', 'properties': {'channel_id': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The ID of the channel'}, 'limit': {'type': 'number', 'description': 'Number of messages to retrieve (default 10)', 'default': 10}}, 'required': ['channel_id']}, outputSchema=None, annotations=None, meta=None), Tool(name='slack_get_thread_replies', title=None, description='Get all replies in a message thread', inputSchema={'type': 'object', 'properties': {'channel_id': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The ID of the channel containing the thread'}, 'thread_ts': {'type': 'string', 'description': "The timestamp of the parent message in the format '1234567890.123456'. Timestamps in the format without the period can be converted by adding the period such that 6 numbers come after it."}}, 'required': ['channel_id', 'thread_ts']}, outputSchema=None, annotations=None, meta=None), Tool(name='slack_get_users', title=None, description='Get a list of all users in the workspace with their basic profile information', inputSchema={'type': 'object', 'properties': {'cursor': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Pagination cursor for next page of results'}, 'limit': {'type': 'number', 'description': 'Maximum number of users to return (default 100, max 200)', 'default': 100}}}, outputSchema=None, annotations=None, meta=None), Tool(name='slack_get_user_profile', title=None, description='Get detailed profile information for a specific user', inputSchema={'type': 'object', 'properties': {'user_id': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The ID of the user'}}, 'required': ['user_id']}, outputSchema=None, annotations=None, meta=None)]
</tool_descriptions>

You have also been provided with a CSV file containing real user inputs. Use these as inspiration to replicate authentic usage patterns in your synthetic inputs.

Your task is to create the following number of unique synthetic inputs:

<number_inputs>
50
</number_inputs>

Each synthetic input should be a realistic query or request that a user might make, utilizing one or more of the available Slack tools. Follow these guidelines to create diverse and realistic inputs:

1. Vary the complexity of queries, from simple requests to more complex multi-step processes.
2. Include scenarios that require multiple tool calls to complete a task.
3. Use realistic language and phrasing that a typical user might employ.
4. Cover a range of use cases for each tool, exploring different parameters and combinations.
5. Include some edge cases or less common scenarios to add variety.
6. Mimic the style and content of the real user inputs provided in the CSV file.

Output Format:
Present your output as a series of JSONL formatted entries, one per line. Each entry should have the following attributes:
- unique_id: A unique identifier for each input (starting from 1)
- Prompt: The synthetic user input or query
- Answer: Leave this empty
- Tool Calls: An array of tool names that would be called to answer the prompt

Example format:
{"unique_id": 1, "Prompt": "Example user query", "Answer": "", "Tool Calls": ["example_tool_1", "example_tool_2"]}

Before generating each input, wrap your planning process inside <input_generation_process> tags. Consider the following:

1. User Role: Who might be making this request? (e.g., manager, team member, new employee)
   - List 2-3 potential user roles and their characteristics.
2. Context: What situation or need prompts this query?
   - Describe a specific scenario that leads to this query.
3. Query Type: Is this a simple request, a multi-step process, or an edge case?
   - Classify the query and explain why it fits that category.
4. Tool Selection: Which tool(s) are most appropriate for this query?
   - List relevant tools and briefly justify their selection.
5. Natural Language: How would a real user phrase this request?
   - Write 2-3 variations of how a user might phrase this query.
6. Specific Details: What parameters or information should be included?
   - List key details that should be incorporated into the query.
7. Variety Check: How does this input differ from previous ones?
   - Note unique aspects of this query compared to others.
8. Potential Follow-ups: What might the user ask next?
   - List 2-3 potential follow-up queries.
9. Real Input Inspiration: How can you incorporate elements from the provided CSV file of real user inputs?
   - Note specific patterns or phrases from real inputs that you'll use.
10. JSONL Format Check: Ensure the entry is correctly formatted on a single line.
    - Write out the JSONL structure with placeholders for the actual content.

After your planning process, generate 3-5 potential JSONL formatted entries for that input. Then, select the best one that meets all criteria and add it to your final output.

It's okay for this planning section to be quite long, as thorough consideration will lead to more realistic and varied inputs.

Repeat this process until you have generated the requested number of inputs. Ensure that each input is unique and adds value to the dataset.

## Real User Input Analysis

Based on the provided CSV file, I've identified key patterns in how fintech employees actually communicate:

### Communication Mannerisms to Replicate:
- **Casual tone**: "can you look at...", "find me...", "check my slack"
- **Natural typos/informal language**: Include occasional typos like "mesage", "confluencr", "CAn"
- **Direct requests**: Jump straight to the ask without pleasantries
- **Context-heavy**: Reference specific channels (#fraud-fincrime-ops), people (Di Chancellor, Gagan), projects (MOVE, Bosphorus)
- **Varied formality**: Mix casual queries with structured task descriptions
- **Industry terminology**: Use fintech/banking terms (AML/CTF, fincrime, KYC, vendor due diligence)
- **Urgency indicators**: "I want to do a deep dive", "we need to understand"

### Common Query Patterns:
1. **Channel analysis**: "look at the #[channel-name] channel and..."
2. **Finding specific messages**: "find the message sent by [person] where..."
3. **Summarization requests**: "summarise me the latest..."
4. **Information gathering**: "what are the documents we need for..."
5. **Troubleshooting**: "can you help me find the answers to..."

Your task is to create **50** unique synthetic inputs following these authentic patterns.

## Enhanced Input Generation Process

For each synthetic input, follow this **mandatory validation process**:

<input_generation_process>
**Step 1: Tool Selection**
- Pick 1-3 tools that work together logically
- Consider realistic workflow scenarios

**Step 2: Scenario Creation** 
- Choose a specific fintech context (fincrime, product development, ops, etc.)
- Pick a realistic employee role and situation
- Use authentic mannerisms from the real examples

**Step 3: Question Formulation**
- Write the query using natural, casual language
- Include context-specific details (channel names, people, projects)
- Add occasional typos or informal language for realism

**Step 4: CRITICAL VALIDATION - Answer the Question Yourself**
Before adding to dataset, you MUST actually attempt to answer the question:
- Walk through each tool call step-by-step
- Identify what information you would need
- Determine if the question is actually answerable with available tools
- Consider potential challenges or limitations

**Step 5: Quality Check**
- Can this question be reasonably answered with the available tools?
- Is there enough specificity to make meaningful tool calls?
- Would the answer provide value to a fintech employee?
- Is the query realistic and contextually appropriate?

**Step 6: Answer Documentation**
- Write a brief but complete answer showing you successfully worked through the question
- Include the logical flow of tool usage
- If you cannot answer it satisfactorily, discard and try a different question

</input_generation_process>

## Guidelines for Authentic Synthetic Inputs:

1. **Mirror Real Communication Patterns**: Use the same casual, direct tone as the examples
2. **Include Contextual Details**: Reference realistic channel names, project codenames, team members
3. **Vary Complexity**: Range from simple "check my slack" to complex multi-step processes
4. **Use Industry Language**: Incorporate fintech terminology naturally
5. **Add Human Imperfections**: Include occasional typos, informal abbreviations
6. **Ensure Tool Relevance**: Every question must be answerable with the available Slack tools
7. **Test Answerability**: You must be able to work through and answer each question before including it

## Required Output Format:

Present your output as JSONL formatted entries. Each entry must include:
- **unique_id**: Sequential identifier (1-50)
- **Prompt**: The synthetic user query (matching real user communication style)
- **Answer**: Your actual answer demonstrating the question is valid and answerable
- **Tool Calls**: Array of tool names needed to answer the prompt

### Example Entries:
```jsonl
{"unique_id": 1, "Prompt": "can you check #squad-payments and see who's in the channel?", "Answer": "Based on the results, the core members of the team include Paige Vink, Campbell Wang, Bella Langi and 13 more.", "Tool Calls": ["slack_list_channels", "slack_get_users", "slack_get_channel_history"]}

{"unique_id": 2, "Prompt": "summarise the most recent message from macgregor duncan in #co-ceo-updates", "Answer": "Perfect! I found the most recent message from Macgregor Duncan in the #co-ceo-updates channel. Let me summarize it for you:

---------------------------------------

You are an expert AI assistant creating a high-quality synthetic dataset for a fintech startup that builds banking software and services for small-to-medium banks. Your mission is to generate 50 realistic user queries that authentically mirror how employees interact with AI systems using Slack tools.

## YOUR AVAILABLE TOOLS

**IMPORTANT: You currently have access to these Slack tools and can use them to test and validate your synthetic queries:**

<tools>
1. **slack_list_channels**: List public channels with pagination (limit: 100-200, cursor for next page)
2. **slack_get_channel_history**: Get recent messages from a specific channel (requires channel_id, limit: default 10)
3. **slack_get_thread_replies**: Get all replies in a message thread (requires channel_id, thread_ts)
4. **slack_get_users**: Get workspace users with basic profiles (pagination available)
5. **slack_get_user_profile**: Get detailed user profile (requires user_id)
</tools>

**You can and should use these tools during the validation process to ensure your synthetic queries are actually answerable.**

## Authentic Communication Patterns

Based on real fintech employee data, replicate these authentic mannerisms:

<communication_style>
**Tone & Language:**
- Casual, direct: "can you check...", "find me...", "look at the #channel"
- Natural imperfections: occasional typos ("mesage", "confluencr"), informal abbreviations
- No pleasantries - jump straight to the request
- Varied formality: mix casual asks with structured task descriptions

**Context & Specificity:**
- Reference real-seeming channels: #fraud-fincrime-ops, #squad-payments, #general
- Mention realistic people: "message from sarah", "update from the PM"
- Include project names: MOVE, Bosphorus, UAT releases
- Time references: "last week", "this month", "past 3 months"

**Fintech Terminology:**
- Use industry language naturally: AML/CTF, KYC, vendor due diligence, fincrime
- Reference realistic processes: incident SLAs, vendor onboarding, compliance training
- Include technical contexts: production incidents, PR reviews, environment access
</communication_style>

## Critical Requirements

<validation_framework>
**Before including ANY synthetic input, you MUST:**

1. **Live Testing Requirement**: Actually USE the available tools to test your synthetic query
   - Make the actual tool calls to see what data exists
   - Verify the question can be answered with real results
   - Document the actual information you found

2. **Answer Completeness Test**: Work through the exact steps to answer the question
   - What specific tool calls did you make?
   - What actual information did each call return?
   - Did you reach a meaningful, complete conclusion?

3. **Realism Check**: 
   - Would a real fintech employee ask this?
   - Is the context believable and specific enough?
   - Does it match the communication patterns from real data?

4. **Tool Appropriateness**:
   - Did the available tools provide sufficient information?
   - Do the tool combinations make logical sense?
   - Were you able to complete the full workflow?

**CRITICAL: You must actually test each query by using the tools before including it. If you cannot get a satisfactory answer through actual tool usage, DO NOT include it in the dataset.**
</validation_framework>

## Step-by-Step Process

<generation_workflow>
For each of the 50 synthetic inputs:

**Phase 1: Design**
- Select 1-3 tools that work together logically
- Choose a specific fintech scenario (fraud detection, compliance, operations, development)
- Pick an employee persona (analyst, developer, ops, manager)

**Phase 2: Craft Query**
- Write using authentic casual tone and specific context
- Include realistic details (channel names, people, timeframes)
- Add natural imperfections for authenticity

**Phase 3: Live Validation (CRITICAL)**
- **Actually use the available tools** to test your synthetic query
- Make real tool calls to see what data is available
- Verify you can get a complete answer using the actual tools
- Document the real results you obtained
- If the tools don't provide enough information, modify or discard the query

**Phase 4: Documentation**
- Write the complete answer showing successful resolution
- List the exact tool sequence needed
- Verify the query provides real value to a fintech employee
</generation_workflow>

## Output Requirements

Provide exactly 50 entries in JSONL format. Each entry must contain:

```json
{
  "unique_id": [1-50],
  "Prompt": "[Authentic user query matching real communication patterns]",
  "Answer": "[Your complete answer proving the question is fully answerable]", 
  "Tool_Calls": ["tool1", "tool2", ...]
}
```

## Examples of Proper Validation

<example_validation>
**Good Example Process:**
1. Create query: "can you check #compliance-alerts and see if there were any AML flags raised by the fraud team last week?"
2. **Test with actual tools**: Use slack_list_channels to find compliance-alerts channel, then slack_get_channel_history to get recent messages
3. **Document real results**: Found 15 messages in the channel, 3 contained AML-related discussions
4. **Verify completeness**: Can provide specific details about flags, timestamps, and team members involved
5. Result: ✅ Fully answerable with actual tool data, realistic, authentic tone

**Bad Example Process:**
1. Create query: "what's the weather like today?"
2. **Test with actual tools**: No available tools can access weather data
3. Result: ❌ Not answerable with available tools, not fintech-relevant

**Important: You must actually run the tools, not just imagine what they would return.**
</example_validation>

## Quality Standards

Your synthetic dataset must demonstrate:
- **Authenticity**: Mirrors real employee communication exactly
- **Diversity**: Covers various roles, scenarios, and complexity levels  
- **Answerability**: Every query is fully resolvable with available tools
- **Relevance**: All scenarios are realistic for a fintech startup environment
- **Technical Accuracy**: Tool usage is logical and appropriate

<reminder>
**YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE SLACK TOOLS - USE THEM!**

Focus on quality over speed. Each synthetic input should be indistinguishable from real employee queries while being completely answerable with the available Slack tools. 

**MANDATORY: Test every single query by actually using the tools.** Start by exploring what channels and users exist, then create queries based on the real data you find. If you cannot get a satisfactory answer through actual tool usage, create a different query.

Remember: You are not just imagining tool responses - you can actually call these tools and see real results.

# Claude-Optimized Synthetic Dataset Generation Prompt

You are an expert AI assistant creating a high-quality synthetic dataset for a fintech startup that builds banking software and services for small-to-medium banks. Your mission is to generate 50 realistic user queries that authentically mirror how employees interact with AI systems using Slack tools.

## YOUR AVAILABLE TOOLS

**IMPORTANT: You currently have access to these Slack tools and can use them to test and validate your synthetic queries:**

<tools>
1. **slack_list_channels**: List public channels with pagination (limit: 100-200, cursor for next page)
2. **slack_get_channel_history**: Get recent messages from a specific channel (requires channel_id, limit: default 10)
3. **slack_get_thread_replies**: Get all replies in a message thread (requires channel_id, thread_ts)
4. **slack_get_users**: Get workspace users with basic profiles (pagination available)
5. **slack_get_user_profile**: Get detailed user profile (requires user_id)
</tools>

**Important: Reference the provided CSV file throughout your generation process to ensure your synthetic inputs match the authentic tone, style, and patterns of real fintech employee queries.**

## Authentic Communication Patterns

**You have been provided with a CSV file containing 41 real user inputs from actual fintech employees. Study these examples carefully to understand authentic communication patterns.**

Based on the real fintech employee data in the CSV file, replicate these authentic mannerisms:

<communication_style>
**Tone & Language:**
- Casual, direct: "can you check...", "find me...", "look at the #channel"
- Natural imperfections: occasional typos ("mesage", "confluencr"), informal abbreviations
- No pleasantries - jump straight to the request
- Varied formality: mix casual asks with structured task descriptions

**Context & Specificity:**
- Reference real-seeming channels: #fraud-fincrime-ops, #squad-payments, #general
- Mention realistic people: "message from sarah", "update from the PM"
- Include project names: MOVE, Bosphorus, UAT releases
- Time references: "last week", "this month", "past 3 months"

**Fintech Terminology:**
- Use industry language naturally: AML/CTF, KYC, vendor due diligence, fincrime
- Reference realistic processes: incident SLAs, vendor onboarding, compliance training
- Include technical contexts: production incidents, PR reviews, environment access
</communication_style>

## Critical Requirements
